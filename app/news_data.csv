Even bigger! Giant Royal Caribbean ship is the largest ever to call Los Angeles home,https://thepointsguy.com/news/royal-caribbean-ovation-largest-ship-los-angeles/,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:00:59 +0000",Lyndsey Matthews,News,"<p><span>Los Angeles residents have a new way to cruise to Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span>On May 31, </span><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/cruise/royal-caribbean/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span>Royal Caribbean</span></a><span> repositioned the massive Ovation of the Seas to the Port of Los Angeles for </span><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/best-mexico-cruises/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span>Mexico cruises</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>“We are here in a big way,” said Vicki Freed, Royal Caribbean&#8217;s senior vice president for sales, at a Q&amp;A on a preview sailing of the new route for media and travel agents. She meant that both literally and figuratively.</span></p>
<p><span>The 4,182-passenger Ovation of the Seas is the first Royal Caribbean <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/royal-caribbean-ship-class-guide/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Quantum Class</a> ship based in Los Angeles — and also the largest ship ever to sail out of that port based on capacity. (At 168,666 gross tons, it&#8217;s just slightly smaller than the 169,116-ton </span><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/reviews/norwegian-encore-cruise-ship/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span>Norwegian Encore</span></a>,<span> also based there.)</span></p>
<p><span>Launched in 2016, Ovation of the Seas is one of Royal Caribbean’s five </span><span>Quantum Class </span><span>ships and includes amenities like indoor skydiving, bumper cars and the North Star observation capsule that lifts passengers 300 feet above sea level.</span></p>
<p><span>The Mexico itineraries out of Los Angeles on Ovation of the Seas range from three to eight nights in length and visit ports such as Catalina Island, California, and Ensenada and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.</span></p>

<p><span>This repositioning also marks a major West Coast expansion for Royal Caribbean, which previously only sailed the 3,368-passenger </span><span>Navigator of the Seas</span><span> from Los Angeles to Mexico. </span>Navigator will continue sailing from Los Angeles until October 2026.</p>
<p><span>“When we say West Coast is the ‘best coast,’ we’re coming out strong,” Freed said.</span></p>
<p><span>This October, </span><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/royal-caribbean-los-angeles-cruise-quantum/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span>Quantum of the Seas</span></a><span> (another Quantum Class ship of a similar size to Ovation) will also begin to sail from Los Angeles to Mexico. </span><span>The slightly smaller 3,602-passenger <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/cruise/reviews/voyager-of-the-seas-cruise-ship/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Voyager of the Seas</a> will also sail from Los Angeles starting in October 2026.</span></p>
<p><span>Freed also announced the 2,143-passenger Serenade of the Seas will sail from San Diego to Mexico starting in October 2026 for the winter season. This will mark Royal Caribbean&#8217;s return to San Diego after a long absence. The t</span>hree-to-seven-night itineraries will include stops in Cabo San Lucas and Ensenada, as well as La Paz, Mexico, which will be a new destination for the brand.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1810674"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1810674"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1810674"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/06/20250603_Royal-Caribbean-Ovation-of-the-Seas_LMatthews-34.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1810674"" class=""wp-caption-text"">LYNDSEY MATTHEWS/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Royal Caribbean originally planned for Ovation of the Seas to sail out of Tianjin, China, this summer, but it ultimately decided to move the vessel to Los Angeles as part of this West Coast expansion.</span></p>
<p><span>Ovation of the Seas sailed from Japan before arriving in Los Angeles on May 31. After its first summer season sailing from Los Angeles to Mexico, Ovation of the Seas will relocate to its Asian home dock in Singapore from October 2025 to March 2026. From</span> May to September 2026, Ovation will return to <span>its typical summer season sailing to</span> Alaska, but this time from Seward, Alaska, and Vancouver, British Columbia, instead of Seattle. In September 2026, Ovation will return to Los Angeles, where it will remain until April 2027.</p>
<p><span>Royal Caribbean isn’t the only cruise line expanding its presence in Los Angeles. </span><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/cruise/virgin/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span>Virgin Voyages</span></a><span> will launch its </span><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/brilliant-lady-cruise-itineraries/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span>first Los Angeles sailings</span></a><span> in 2026 on board the brand-new Brilliant Lady, which can accommodate 2,770 passengers. </span></p>
<p><span>In 2024, </span><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/cruise/carnival/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span>Carnival Cruise Line</span></a><span> began sailing one of its </span><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/carnival-firenze-cruise-ship-debut/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span>newest ships</span></a><span>, Carnival Firenze, from the Port of Long Beach, just a few miles from the Port of Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p>The West Coast cruise market to Mexico is certainly heating up. Hopefully, that will mean all kinds of deals for potential passengers to take advantage of &#8230; or at least more convenient sailing dates for more travelers.</p>

Thrifty Traveler Premium is half off right now: Get flight deals straight to your inbox,https://thepointsguy.com/deals/thrifty-traveler-premium-deal/,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 15:50:48 +0000",Clint Henderson,Deals,"<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This post was updated with new information.</em></p>
<p>You’re no stranger to our frequent <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/deals/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">deal alerts</a> if you regularly read TPG.</p>
<p>Thrifty Traveler is one of the companies where we find flight deals — and right now, in honor of its 10th birthday, the company is throwing the biggest sale of the year on its Thrifty Traveler Premium flight deal alert service.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1811051"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1811051"" style=""width: 1878px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1811051"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-04-at-10.40.54 AM.png"" alt=""THRIFTY TRAVELER SCREENSHOT"" width=""1878"" height=""762"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1811051"" class=""wp-caption-text"">THRIFTY TRAVELER</figcaption></figure>
<p>New subscribers can get 50% off their first year of Thrifty Travel Premium and receive emails about cheap cash deals — and some incredible points and miles bargains — on airline tickets. This half-off sale brings the $99.99 price down to $49.99 for the first year.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this sale, just enter the promo code &#8220;BDAY&#8221; at <a href=""https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8330303-15014585"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">this Thrifty Traveler link</a>.</p>
<p>“Thrifty Traveler Premium finds deals from more than 200 airports in the U.S. and Canada — more than any other service,” the flight service company said in a statement to TPG. “Members can tailor their alerts to get deals only from their home airport, all 200-plus cities, or anything in between.”</p>
<p>According to Thrifty Traveler, here are just a few of the deals sent to subscribers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domestic round-trip flights regularly under $200 (or even under $100) for cross-country travel</li>
<li>Nearly 30 award deals to help members redeem their points and miles, like a <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/ultimate-guide-delta-skymiles/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Delta SkyMiles</a> flash sale to Costa Rica from 16,000 miles round-trip and excellent <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/ultimate-guide-to-qatar-qsuites/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Qatar Airways Qsuite</a> availability to the Middle East or the Maldives in 2025</li>
<li>An unprecedented amount of business-class award space to get to Europe in lie-flat seats last summer, such as wide-open Air France and KLM award seats bookable at just 60,000 <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/ultimate-guide-flying-blue/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Flying Blue</a> miles, seats in United Airlines’ Polaris cabin for 53,000 <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/know-united-mileageplus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">United MileagePlus</a> miles and seats in American Airlines’ business class for 62,000 <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/american-airlines-aadvantage/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">American Airlines AAdvantage</a> miles</li>
<li>Rare and fun award deals, including some of the cheapest SkyMiles rates we’ve seen in years to fly in Delta One to Seoul, South Korea, and incredible rates to fly Emirates first class on the airline’s new route from Miami to Bogota, Colombia</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s another example of a deal alert from Thrifty Traveler that alerted members to a wide-open Air France-KLM Flying Blue deal using just 50,000 miles each way (the lowest award has since risen to 60,000 miles).</p>

<p>When Japan Airlines began flying its new flagship, long-haul Airbus A350-1000s last year, the airline wowed passengers with <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/jal-4-class-cabin-review/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">all-new classes of service</a>, including business-class suites with closing doors and ultracomfortable <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/airline/reviews/japan-airlines-premium-economy-review/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">premium economy recliners</a>.</p>
<p>However, it was Japan Airlines’ new first-class suites that were the true stunners, thanks to their incredible amount of personal space, stylish design finishes and up-to-the-second technology.</p>
<p>After first getting a glimpse of them on the A350 inaugural from New York to Tokyo last year, I’ve been dreaming about actually getting to experience them on a transpacific flight ever since, and I finally got the chance to do so a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Here’s what it was like flying Japan Airlines’ new first class and all the treats in store for passengers.</p>
<h2>How much does it cost to book Japan Airlines first class?</h2>
<figure id=""attachment_1808608"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808608"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808608"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-HND-airport-JAL-jets.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808608"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan Airlines only flies its A350-1000s on a handful of routes out of Tokyo&#8217;s Haneda Airport (HND), including ones to John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York and <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/dfw-airport-asia-pacific-nonstop-flights-surge/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)</a>.</p>
<p>The one-way airfare for my flight from DFW to HND would have cost $19,541, while round trips over the next several months start at $26,387. Fortunately, I was able to use points for my ticket instead.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808602"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808602"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808602"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-DFW-HND-paid-fare.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""806"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808602"" class=""wp-caption-text"">JAPAN AIRLINES</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, you could use miles from the airline’s own <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/japan-airlines-mileage-bank/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Japan Airlines Mileage Bank</a> program, but it is not the easiest frequent flyer program to accrue miles with. However, if you are interested in doing this, you can transfer points to it from <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/bilt-rewards-guide/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Bilt Rewards</a> at a 1:1 ratio and <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/award-travelers-guide-to-marriott-bonvoy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Marriott Bonvoy</a> at a 3:1 ratio.</p>
<p>Japan Airlines is a member of <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/oneworld-alliance-benefits/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Oneworld</a>, so you can redeem <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/american-airlines-aadvantage/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">American Airlines AAdvantage</a> or <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/alaska-mileage-plan-guide/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan</a> miles for award flights on the airline, but premium awards are very scarce these days.</p>
<p>So, how did I find my award ticket? Japan Airlines <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/jetblue-trueblue-redemptions-japan-airlines/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">also now partners with JetBlue</a>, and in April, there was an <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/deals/japan-airlines-first-class-awards-jetblue-points/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">incredible opportunity to book Japan Airlines first- and business-class awards</a> from various U.S. airports throughout much of 2025 and into 2026 using <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/jetblue-trueblue-program/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">JetBlue TrueBlue</a> points.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808603"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808603"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808603"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-DFW-HND.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""921"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808603"" class=""wp-caption-text"">JETBLUE</figcaption></figure>
<p>Although that inventory disappeared within a day, I managed to snag an award by transferring <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/ultimate-guide-amex-membership-rewards/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">American Express Membership Rewards</a> points to my TrueBlue account and booking that way. Amex points transfer to TrueBlue at a 5:4 ratio, so it cost me nearly 232,000 Amex points in order to end up with the 185,000 TrueBlue points I would need for my trip. But that still felt worth it since I was getting more than 8.3 cents in value per Amex point and more than 10.4 cents in value per JetBlue TrueBlue point.</p>
<p>Here’s a snapshot of the points or miles (plus any taxes and fees) you’d need one-way between Japan and the U.S. by booking through any of the above programs.</p>

It took just a minute for me to check my bag and then be escorted to the front of the security line, where I was able to take advantage of <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/is-tsa-precheck-worth-it/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TSA PreCheck</a> to zip through the checkpoint quickly.</p>

<p>I had a little time, so I headed to the American Airlines Flagship Lounge for a coffee and some fruit and yogurt before popping back down to the main concourse and over to the nearby gate.</p>
<p>First-class passengers, along with those who need extra time, can board first, so I was among the first onto the plane.</p>

<h2>How comfortable is Japan Airlines first class?</h2>
<p>Each Japan Airlines A350-1000 has just six new first-class suites on board. They are arranged in two rows of three seats, each in a 1-1-1 pattern, so there are two window suites on each side of the cabin and two down the center.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the two center suites open up to different aisles, so 1D opens to the left aisle and 2D opens to the right. That means if you are in 1K or 2A, you won’t see directly into anyone’s seat across from you.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at how the cabin is laid out and the seat dimensions.</p>

<p>As you can see, each suite is enormous, at 4 feet across with 83 inches of pitch. That’s nearly 28 square feet of space per passenger. The suites also have closing doors that are 62 inches high, so they don’t go all the way up to the ceiling, but they do provide a lot of privacy.</p>

<p>Footprint aside, it’s the high-end finishes that truly impress. With burgundy-toned upholstery, these seats were designed to resemble luxury train compartments with stylized elements like gold-chrome sconce lights and finely patterned stitching.</p>

<p>The seat portion is composed of a long banquette that’s wide enough for two people, though a portion of this is a smaller seat with a back that can be lowered to form a small side faux-marble table, a nice touch for when you want somewhere to put a drink but don’t want to pull out the dining table.</p>

<p>The suites’ doors are made from frosted glass designed to resemble traditional Japanese shoji screens, with bamboo-inspired patterns etched on them and in the metalwork that crowns them.</p>

<p>If you look closely at the seat’s headrest, you&#8217;ll see that the wings are actually speakers through which you can listen to your entertainment selection without the need for headphones.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808633"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808633"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808633"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-seat-headrest-speakers.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808633"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the counter surface between the seat and the window, I found a tablet to control everything from the entertainment system to the seat position and the lights. It automatically unhooked when you touched it, making a clicking sound, though it reengaged when you left it in its slot.</p>

<p>Below the tablet are various buttons for moving the seat into preset positions for takeoff and landing, dining, relaxing and sleeping, as well as toggles to adjust the individual parts of the seat and buttons for the reading and overhead lights and to call the flight attendant.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808648"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808648"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808648"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-seat-tablet.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808648"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Across from the seat is a large ottoman that doubles as a jump seat with its own belt if you want to dine with someone in your suite. This is also the footrest in lie-flat mode and is 30 inches across, providing plenty of surface area for your feet when sleeping.</p>

<p>Next to this, there is another large marblelike surface that is a good spot to place a laptop or the amenity kit when you’re not using it.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808599"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808599"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808599"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-center-seat-over-straight.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808599"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The table is part of a console that pulls out from the seat’s front shell and then pops up from that. It is impressively huge, measuring 24 inches wide and 20 inches tall, though it is a little hard to maneuver your way out of the seat if you need to get up during a meal, despite the table sliding back and forth along a track.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808598"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808598"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808598"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-center-seat-lower.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808598"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The seat’s 43-inch 4K entertainment screen (more on that later) is among the largest, if not the largest, currently available on an airline.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808641"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808641"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808641"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-seat-screen_.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808641"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>You might notice that there are no overhead bins in the cabin, which the airline decided to do without in order to retain an open, airy feel. For that reason, there are plenty of storage cubbies and compartments, including one beneath the ottoman that can fit up to two standard-size rollaboards. Next to the door, there is also a compartment that doubles as a hanging closet and has a full-length mirror that slides out, which is handy.</p>
<p>Next to where the table slides out from, there is a large lower compartment that was not quite deep enough for my MacBook Pro but did hold the blanket when I wasn’t using it. Additionally, there&#8217;s a smaller compartment with a frosted-glass door where you can put a bottle of water. The marbleized countertop has another cubby embedded in it with a pop-up lid as well, which I found useful for stowing the amenity kit.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808597"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808597"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808597"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-center-seat-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808597"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Feel free to bring all your electronic devices on board since there are three different places in the seat with power points, including a universal plug and USB-A and -C ports: one on the window side of the seat, one next to the smaller chair portion of the seat and one underneath the entertainment screen.</p>

<p>There is also a wireless charging pad on the armrest next to the seat, though I found it only maintained my iPhone at its current level rather than properly charging it.</p>
<p>While I brushed my teeth after the first meal, a flight attendant turned down the bed with a dual-sided Airweave mattress pad with a firm surface on one side and a softer one on the other (which I’ve seen retail for close to $1,000), plus a large duvet.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808590"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808590"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808590"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-bed-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808590"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The size of the sleeping surface felt downright luxurious, with space to roll over from one side to the other, and I got a solid six hours of uninterrupted sleep. It was truly one of the most comfortable rests I’ve had on a plane in years.</p>

<p>The first-class cabin has two dedicated lavatories — not a bad passenger-to-bathroom ratio! The larger one was at the front left, near the cockpit, while the smaller one was just in front of 2A through a set of curtains (before you hit the galley).</p>

<p>The flight attendants kept them spotless and stocked with dental kits, mouthwash and Cle de Peau Beaute serum and moisturizer. I also appreciated that the sink and toilet flush were touchless.</p>
<p>The cabin does not have overhead air nozzles, but given the large footprint of each suite, I was able to ask the flight attendants to keep my specific area relatively cool, which they did throughout the flight.</p>

<h2>Amenities in Japan Airlines first class</h2>
<p>When I got to my seat, it was provisioned with a few creature comforts, including two Airweave pillows, one soft and medium in size and the other firmer and larger. There were also a light blanket and a set of cloth slippers.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808637"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808637"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808637"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-seat-pillows.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808637"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Shortly after I settled in, the flight attendant who would be taking care of me throughout the flight came by to ask if I would like loungewear. The medium-size, beige-colored set she brought me fit well, and the fabric was almost more like a light sweatsuit rather than cotton, though it was still breathable.</p>

<p>The suite’s 43-inch entertainment screen was so large that watching movies on it felt like being in a home theater. The system was not stocked with tons of options, but there were relatively recent releases (well, from last summer) like “Twisters” and “Inside Out 2.” Mostly, I kept it on the map function and the tail camera.</p>

<p>The most uncommon feature is the set of speakers embedded into the headrest of the main portion of the seat so you can listen to the entertainment without needing headphones. They work in such a way that the noise is just audible within your suite, so you won’t disturb your neighbors. (I tested it by turning the system to full volume before stepping into the aisle to try to listen.)</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808607"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808607"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808607"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-headphones.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808607"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, the sound quality was not top-of-the-line, and the volume was not always easy to hear, so I asked for a set of Bang &amp; Olufsen noise-canceling headphones to use instead. Those worked really well.</p>
<p>I needed to use the Wi-Fi during my flight to keep current on work and found the following plan pricing.</p>

<h2>How was the food and drink in Japan Airlines first class?</h2>
<p>Before departure, the flight attendant came back to offer me water, juice or a smoothie. After we were airborne for about 20 minutes, the purser came by taking drink orders and suggested that if I liked Champagne (I do!), I have a glass of the 2013 Salon currently being served on board.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808625"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808625"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808625"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-Salon-champagne-bottle.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808625"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s widely acknowledged that this is one of the nicest, if not the nicest, Champagnes served by any airline at the moment and retails for around $1,200 a bottle. There have been reports that Japan Airlines only stocks this on flights out of Tokyo, so I wasn’t expecting to see it on mine, but I was thrilled to have a taste, and it did not disappoint.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808626"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808626"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808626"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-Salon-champagne-horiz.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808626"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Several of the other first-class passengers also ordered it, but the flight attendants were able to pour it judiciously so that each of us got two small glasses out of the single bottle on board. I enjoyed mine with an amuse bouche of two little tarts, one with lobster and the other with pea puree and tomato.</p>
<p>You can preorder your main meal ahead of time, which I did. I chose the Japanese menu, which I was not afraid would become unavailable because there were only six passengers in first class.</p>
<p>The airline currently works with eight chefs, including Hideki Ishikawa, who has three restaurants that hold a total of seven Michelin stars and designed the “washoku” Japanese tasting menu for my flight.</p>
<p>It started with a smattering of small bites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simmered conger eel in sansho soy sauce with spinach</li>
<li>Sweet potato and prawn in tofu sauce</li>
<li>Smoked salmon with caviar, papaya and lemon jelly</li>
<li>Simmered scallop with bell pepper and fried bean curd in dashi broth</li>
<li>Nori-flavored bamboo shoots</li>
</ul>
<figure id=""attachment_1808615"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808615"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808615"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-meal-first-course-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808615"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>I love starting a meal this way, with lots of savory tapas. After that, it was on to a soup course of broth with rice cracker-coated lobster and spring vegetables, which was smoky but light.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808622"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808622"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808622"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-meal-soup.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808622"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next was roast beef with sesame sauce and green asparagus alongside fava bean potage with steamed sea urchin.</p>

<p>The main course comprised steamed sea bream with citrus soy sauce, silken tofu, white leeks and Chinese cabbage and came with pickles, a bowl of miso soup and a choice of rice, either plain and steamed or flavored with seaweed and green pea.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808618"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808618"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808618"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-meal-main-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808618"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>

<p>The meal was elaborate and beautifully presented, so it took about 90 minutes to get through, given how many dishes were served. However, each was unique and tasty, and I was in no hurry since the flight was nearly 13 hours.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering, the international menu was created by Japan Airlines’ longtime corporate chef, Naoki Uchiyama, and included dishes like balik smoked salmon carpaccio with fried caper, roe and dill vinaigrette; USDA Prime beef tenderloin with artichoke truffle flan and both chimichurri and Madeira sauce; and creme fraiche cheesecake.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of the flight, passengers could order light a la carte meals that included a condensed version of the Japanese menu or Dungeness crab risotto and a yogurt-honey dessert. I skipped this to sleep instead.</p>
<p>About two hours before landing, I asked for my second main meal, which included a choice of starters and mains.</p>
<p>There were snacks of monkfish liver with yuzu-soy jelly and assorted seafood skewers, caviar, corn-saffron soup and fresh salad.</p>
<p>The mains included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hot smoked salmon melt</li>
<li>Korean bibimbap</li>
<li>Mushroom stroganoff fettuccine</li>
<li>Vegan curry with potatoes and onions</li>
<li>Japan Airlines’ specialty vegan tonkotsu-flavored miso ramen</li>
</ul>
<p>For dessert, there were cheese, assorted fruits, ice cream and Dr. Sue’s Chocolate.</p>
<p>I chose to start with the little tin of malossol caviar, which was served with teeny, tiny potato blinis, deviled quail eggs and an egg yolk whip.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808612"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808612"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808612"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-meal-caviar.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808612"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>I couldn’t decide on a main course, so the flight attendant suggested I have both the bibimbap and the ramen so I could try two of the airline’s signature dishes. Both were hearty and delicious.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808620"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808620"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808620"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-meal-ramen-bibimbap.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808620"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan Airlines has a truly unique wine program overseen by the airline’s wine adviser, Motohiro Okoshi. The star of the show is, of course, the Salon, which you should absolutely try if it’s available on your flight.</p>
<p>The other Champagne on offer was Bollinger La Grande Annee 2015, another exceptional wine that I also enjoyed since it was full-bodied but crisp — a lovely choice for sipping up in the air.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808613"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808613"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808613"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-meal-Champagne-Bollinger-bottle.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808613"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The other wines served on board included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Au Pied du Mont Chauve 2020 white Burgundy</li>
<li>Loosen Urziger Wurzgarten 2022 riesling from Germany</li>
<li>Paul Jaboulet Aine Les Cassines 2020 white from France’s Rhone region</li>
<li>Suntory Tomi No Oka 2022 white wine made in Japan from koshu grapes</li>
<li>Chateau Lagrange 2017 from Bordeaux</li>
<li>Blank Canvas Anthem 2021 pinot noir from New Zealand</li>
<li>Igai Takaha Sono 2022 pinot noir from California</li>
<li>Tiano &amp; Nareno malbec from Argentina</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried the Californian pinot noir, and it was excellent, fresh and fruity but also with a long, elegant finish. It was one of the best red wines I’ve had during a flight lately.</p>

<p>Of course, I couldn’t resist trying a drop of one of the sakes on hand, so I ordered a taste of the Hakurakusei, which is crafted by a historic sake brewery specifically for Japan Airlines to serve at altitude and had heady notes of citrus and melon. The second sake was Jikon Hakutsuru-Nishiki, while the two shochus on the menu were Mori Izo and Kanehachi. I skipped the latter since those are too strong for me.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808621"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808621"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808621"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-meal-sake.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808621"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Spirits and cocktails are also available with some standout labels, including Chivas Regal Royal Salute 21 Year scotch, L&amp;G Woodford Reserve bourbon whiskey and Remy Martin VSOP cognac. The airline also serves Hibiki’s 100th-anniversary Suntory whisky, which retails for around $1,300 a bottle.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808623"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808623"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808623"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-meal-whisky.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808623"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>As for beer, you’ll find the usual suspects, including Asahi, Kirin and Sapporo.</p>
<p>The airline also takes pride in its selection of premium juices and teas, including its signature Royal Blue “Queen of Blue” bottled tea (which I’ve had, so I abstained on this flight) and two types of green tea, as well as a selection of French teas from Mariage Freres. The cappuccino I ordered after my nap was made with Mi Cafeto coffee sourced from Finca San Sebastian in Guatemala and was just the boost I needed for the last few hours of the flight.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1808596"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1808596"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1808596"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250527_JAL-A350-First-Class_ERosen-cappuccino.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1808596"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The flight attendants taking care of me and the other first-class passengers were truly stellar. Not only did they carry out the complex meal services flawlessly, but they also passed through the cabin frequently to see if we needed anything else to eat or drink and responded to the call button within 15 seconds anytime I pushed it. They were solicitous and responsive without being fawning and struck the perfect balance of warm service and professional polish.</p>
<h2>Would you recommend Japan Airlines first class?</h2>
<p>Before the coronavirus pandemic, I had the opportunity to fly Japan Airlines’ older first class several times and was always impressed with the service, amenities and comfort. Because of that, I had very high expectations for the new first-class experience. Those expectations were not just met; they were exceeded.</p>

<p>The new suites feel like total game changers for the airline thanks to their privacy, spaciousness and beautiful design elements, as well as the cool new tech incorporated into them. Paired with the airline’s unparalleled service — the crew on this flight was fantastic — and its phenomenal dining-and-drinks program, and it&#8217;s safe to say that this is truly one of the best flight experiences in the world. Now, if only reasonably priced awards were made more available so more flyers could get the chance to try it!<br />

"Honolulu cruise port guide: Address, parking, transportation and key terminal information",https://thepointsguy.com/guide/honolulu-cruise-port-guide/,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 15:00:39 +0000",Sarah Etinas,News,"<p>The Honolulu cruise port, officially known as Honolulu Harbor, welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. It’s located not far from the heart of Honolulu, making it relatively easy to explore the city’s best attractions and neighborhoods. It’s also just a short drive from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL) and the hotel-filled hub of Waikiki.</p>
<p>Most cruises departing from Honolulu Harbor sail around the other Hawaiian Islands, stopping at Kauai, Maui and the Big Island. Some longer-journey cruises take sailors to other Polynesian islands, like Fiji and Tahiti, and other destinations as far as the continental U.S., Canada or New Zealand.</p>
<p>Regardless of where your cruise takes you, your time in Honolulu will make for a beautiful sailaway into — or sail-in from — the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2>Honolulu cruise port address</h2>
<p><strong>Pier 2</strong><br />
521 Ala Moana Blvd.<br />
Honolulu, HI 96813</p>
<p><strong>Pier 11</strong><br />
23 Aloha Tower Drive<br />
Honolulu, HI 96813</p>
<p>The two piers are only about half a mile apart, but it’s important to know which one you’re sailing to and from to make the journey as easy as possible.</p>

<h2>Honolulu cruise terminal directions</h2>
<p><strong>From Waikiki</strong>: Head west from Waikiki on Kalakaua Avenue or Ala Moana Boulevard. Then take Ala Moana Boulevard to Channel Street, which will bring you to the cruise port (Pier 2). The drive should take you about 15 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>From the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu</strong>: Head north on Rodgers Avenue and turn right on Hawaii Route 92. Turn right on Channel Street. The drive should take you about 15 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>From Ko Olina on the west side of the island</strong>: Take Interstate H-1 east to Exit 18A for Hawaii Route 92E/Nimitz Highway toward Waikiki. Follow the same directions as provided above for the airport. The drive will take at least 40 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>From Haleiwa on the North Shore</strong>: Take Interstate H-2 south to Interstate H-1 east, then follow the same directions as above. The drive will take nearly an hour.</p>
<h2>Honolulu cruise port parking</h2>
<h3>On-site parking</h3>
<p>There are no parking garages at the port itself. Aloha Tower Marketplace, near Pier 11, does offer short-term parking (parking for less than a month) when available, though it’s not guaranteed. Prices for this lot hover around $20 per day, though it can vary by availability, seasonality and length of stay.</p>
<h3>Park-and-cruise</h3>
<p>Similarly, there aren’t any park-and-cruise options for the Honolulu cruise port. Your best option is to take a taxi or ride-hailing service.</p>

<h2>Airports near Honolulu cruise port</h2>
<p>HNL is the only major airport on Oahu and will be the airport you’ll fly into to get to the Honolulu cruise port. It&#8217;s about a 15-minute drive from the port.</p>
<p>All major U.S. airlines, as well as several international ones, fly into this airport, with Hawaiian Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines being the most prominent.</p>
<h2>How to get to the Honolulu cruise terminal from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL)</h2>
<figure id=""attachment_1780788"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1780788"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1780788"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/03/Honolulu-Cruise-Port_Daniel-K.-Inouye-International-Airport_Michael-VI.jpg"" alt=""Exterior view of Honolulu's Daniel K.

Inouye International Airport (HNL). MICHAEL VI/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some cruise lines offer transportation between the airport and the cruise terminal, though this is often reserved for travelers who have purchased their airfare through the cruise line as well.</p>
<p>If that option doesn’t work for you or isn’t available to you, a few independent shuttle services can fill the gap. Try LeaLea (starting at $22 per person), Speedi Shuttle (varies but around $25 per person) or Honolulu Airport Transfer ($30 to $40 per person).</p>

<h2>Taxi service from HNL airport to the Honolulu cruise terminal</h2>
<p>Taxis are widely available at HNL, and a ride to the Honolulu cruise terminal usually costs around $40. Designated taxi pickup locations at HNL are limited, but all are on Level 1, usually found at the center medians outside of the baggage claim areas.</p>
<p>Uber (around $30) and Lyft (around $20) are both popular transportation options between the Honolulu airport and the Honolulu cruise terminal. Consider swapping the big-name ride-hailing services for the locally owned Holoholo (around $25) instead. For all three companies, the pickup locations at HNL are found along the center medians on Level 2, specifically the ones in front of lobbies 2, 5/6 and 8.</p>

<h2>Public transit from the airport to the Honolulu cruise terminal</h2>
<p>The only public transportation option to get from HNL to the Honolulu cruise terminal is the public bus, simply called TheBus ($3 per ride). To get to either pier, you’ll ideally want to take Bus 20, which departs every 20 minutes.</p>
<p>For Pier 11, you’ll get off at the S. King Street + Bethel Street stop in the middle of Chinatown. It&#8217;s about 0.3 miles from the port entrance. This ride takes about 30 minutes. For Pier 2, you’ll get off at the Ala Moana Boulevard + Opp South Street stop and walk the remaining 0.2 miles. This ride takes just under 40 minutes. Keep in mind that since neither of these stops is actually at the cruise terminal, you’ll have to lug your suitcases the remainder of the way.</p>

ASTON</figcaption></figure>
<p>There aren’t any hotels within reasonable walking distance of the Honolulu cruise port, but there are many within a 15-minute drive. No Honolulu hotels offer designated port shuttles or stay-park-cruise promotions, so you’ll need a taxi or ride-hailing service to get you to the port.</p>
<h3>Aston at the Executive Centre Hotel</h3>
<p>Located in the heart of downtown Honolulu, the Aston at the Executive Centre Hotel is primarily targeted at business executives, but it’s one of the closest accommodations to Honolulu Harbor, just under a mile away. Part of the Aqua Aston A-List program, this hotel offers modern guest rooms, plus a few converted condo-style suites with full kitchens.</p>
<h3>Ala Moana Hotel</h3>
<p>Adjacent to the popular Ala Moana Center, the world’s largest open-air shopping center, and a 10-minute drive from Honolulu Harbor, the midrange Ala Moana Hotel is perfect if you’d like to stock up on essentials — or grab a new cruise outfit or two — before embarkation day. It’s also part of the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/accor-live-limitless/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Accor Live Limitless</a> loyalty program.</p>
<h3>Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort</h3>
<p>Why not stay in famous Waikiki before heading out on your cruise since the city is just 15 minutes from Honolulu Harbor? The luxurious yet family-friendly Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort — bookable using <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/award-travelers-guide-hilton-honors/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Hilton Honors</a> points — is right on the shores of Kahanamoku Beach.</p>

AGALIZA/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s easy enough to make your way from the Honolulu cruise port to some of the city’s best foodie hubs. Chinatown is just a couple of blocks away from Pier 11. There are countless eateries serving up delicious Asian cuisines, but The Pig &amp; The Lady has long been a favorite of locals and visitors alike. It&#8217;s a great choice — if you can snag a table.</p>
<p>Kakaako, another nearby Honolulu neighborhood, is the place for modern, trendy food finds and is just under a mile away from Pier 2. You’ll specifically want to visit Salt at Our Kakaako, a beloved hub of shops and eateries, for a variety of up-and-coming spots to grab a bite.</p>

<h2>Shopping near Honolulu cruise port</h2>
<p>If you need to pick up a few snacks before your cruise, pop over to Palama Express, a tiny convenience store within the Aloha Tower Marketplace — a small shopping area just steps from Pier 11. You’ll find a limited selection of Asian-inspired snacks, drinks and prepackaged meals.</p>
<p>For a more extensive selection, head to Safeway and CVS (called Longs Drugs) found side by side behind Chinatown on the Pali Highway, about a five-minute drive from Pier 11 and a 10-minute drive from Pier 2. Between the two, you should be able to find the necessities, including snacks, drinks and sunscreen.</p>
<p>If neither of those options suffice, you can’t go wrong with the Ala Moana Center, right outside of Waikiki and just 10 minutes from the ports. Here, you can find everything you could possibly need, including a Target, another Longs Drugs (CVS), two ABC stores (tourist-focused shops), a Foodland Farms (local grocery store) and about 350 more shops.</p>

","The Honolulu cruise port, officially known as Honolulu Harbor, welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.

<p>If you ask TPG staffers for a credit card recommendation, there&#8217;s a good chance we&#8217;ll recommend a card that has an <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/guide-credit-card-annual-fees/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">annual fee</a>. Most of <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/best/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">our favorite cards</a> come with many benefits that provide value well beyond their annual fee costs, so we consider them <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/chase/chase-sapphire-preferred-worth-annual-fee/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">well worth paying</a>.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t have to pay an annual fee to have a solid credit card strategy. Whether you&#8217;re new to credit cards and hesitant to make that kind of commitment or you&#8217;re sticking to a tight budget, you may decide to opt for one (or more) of the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/no-annual-fee/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">great no-annual-fee credit cards</a> on the market.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to have a credit card strategy without paying an annual fee.</p>
<h2>Cash-back strategy</h2>
<p>Most no-annual-fee credit cards are in the cash-back category. Many <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/best-first-credit-cards/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">beginners</a> prefer the flexibility of cash-back rewards, but they also appeal to more advanced users who don&#8217;t have the time (or the inclination) to worry about maximizing <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/cash-back-vs-points-and-miles/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">points and miles</a>.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1459389"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1459389"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""wp-image-1459389 size-full"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2023/03/Young-woman-using-mobile-pay-with-smartphone-at-street-market_FG-Trade.jpg"" alt=""Using a credit card at a farmers market"" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1459389"" class=""wp-caption-text"">FG TRADE/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>
<p>To maximize your cash-back rewards, try having one <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/why-you-should-get-a-fixed-rate-rewards-credit-card/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">flat-rate earning card</a>, one with <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/flat-rate-vs-bonus-category-cash-back/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">consistent bonus categories</a> and one with rotating categories.</p>
<p>For example, you could stack the following no-annual-fee cash-back cards:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/apply-now/citi-double-cash-card-18-month-bt-offer/?tid=post"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Citi Double Cash® Card</a></strong> (see <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/card-hub/citi-double-cash-card-rates-and-fees/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">rates and fees</a>): Earn 2% back on all purchases (1% when you buy and 1% when you pay your bill).</li>
<li><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-savor-cash-rewards/""><strong>Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card</strong></a>: Earn 5% back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel, 3% back at grocery stores (excluding superstores like Walmart and Target), dining, entertainment and popular streaming services and 1% cash back on all other purchases. Plus, enjoy no foreign transaction fees on purchases outside the U.S.</li>
<li><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/apply-now/chase-freedom-flex/?tid=post"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>Chase Freedom Flex®</strong></a> (see <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/card-hub/chase-freedom-flex-rates-and-fees/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">rates and fees</a>): Earn 5% back on up to the first $1,500 spent on <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/activate-chase-freedom-5x-earnings/"">rotating categories</a> each quarter (activation required), 5% back on travel booked through <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/ultimate-rewards-travel-portal/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Chase Travel℠</a>,  3% on dining (including takeout and eligible delivery services) and on drugstore purchases, 2% back on Lyft rides (through Sept. 30, 2027) and 1% on all other purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just be aware that some cash-back cards do charge an annual fee, so check the card&#8217;s fine print before applying.</p>

<h2>Travel rewards strategy</h2>
<p>Even those who want to earn travel rewards on their cards have options for no-annual-fee cards.</p>
<h3>Hotel and airline cobranded cards</h3>
<p>Generally, <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/airline/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">airline</a> and <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/hotel/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">hotel</a> cobranded cards that don&#8217;t charge annual fees won&#8217;t come with many perks.</p>
<p>Some no-annual-fee hotel cards offer <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/best-hotel-elite-status/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">automatic elite status</a> with on-property benefits; these cards are best for newer travelers or those who aren&#8217;t loyal to one particular hotel chain.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1787769"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1787769"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1787769"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/03/ka-lai-room.jpg"" alt=""Hilton's Ka La'i Waikiki Beach LXR resort"" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1787769"" class=""wp-caption-text"">HILTON</figcaption></figure>
<p>The no-annual-fee <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/apply-now/hilton-hhonors-card-from-american-express/?tid=post"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Hilton Honors American Express Card</a> (see <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/apply/hilton-honors-card-from-american-express-rates-fees/?tid=post"">rates and fees</a>), for example, comes with automatic <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/what-is-hilton-elite-status-worth/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Hilton Silver elite status</a>, which allows you to take advantage of the program&#8217;s <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/free-night-award-stays/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">fifth-night-free benefit</a>.</p>
<p>As for no-annual-fee airline cards, these generally come with inflight discounts for that airline. They may also offer additional perks if you meet a certain spending threshold. For example, the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/apply-now/united-gateway-card/?tid=post"">United Gateway℠ Card</a> (see <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/card-hub/united-gateway-card-rates-and-fees/"">rates and fees</a>) offers a 25% discount as a statement credit for inflight food, beverages and Wi-Fi.</p>
<h3>Transferable rewards cards</h3>
<p>While not very common, some no-annual-fee cards earn <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/why-transferable-points-worth-more/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">transferable rewards</a>. The <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/apply-now/the-blue-business%e2%84%a0-plus-credit-card-from-american-express/?tid=post"">Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express</a>, for example, has no annual fee (see <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/apply/the-blue-business%e2%84%a0-plus-credit-card-from-american-express-rates-fees/?tid=post"">rates and fees</a>) and earns <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/ultimate-guide-amex-membership-rewards/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Membership Rewards</a> points that you can transfer to any of <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/membership-rewards-partner-guide/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Amex&#8217;s 21 hotel and airline partners</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/ways-you-might-be-eligible-for-business-credit-card/"">qualifying for a business card</a>, it&#8217;s a lot easier than you might think. Even a simple side hustle like dog walking is enough to <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/guide-to-applying-small-business-credit-cards/"">get a card</a> like the Blue Business Plus.</p>

The site — along with all the fun and informative points, miles and travel content on our social and video channels — has come a long way since Brian Kelly started blogging about his travel hobby as a small side hustle during nights, weekends and breaks from his day job back in 2010.</p>
<p>While so very much has changed — not only at TPG as it grew from Brian’s small side project into the 100-plus-employee business it is today but also with rewards loyalty programs and the travel industry — in that time, Capital One miles have always been central to our points and miles strategy here at TPG.</p>
<p>In fact, one way Brian continues to earn many of the miles he has racked up over the years with his own endeavors and business spending is by using the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-venture-x-business/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Capital One Venture X Business card</a> for some of his own everyday business purchases.</p>
<p>The card is currently offering an increased welcome bonus of up to 350,000 miles — you can earn 150,000 bonus miles after spending $30,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening and an additional 200,000 bonus miles after spending $200,000 on purchases in the first six months from account opening. This offer ends June 9.</p>
<p>If you hit those spending marks to trigger the full bonus, you will end up with at least 750,000 Capital One miles from the bonus and the spending since the card earns 2 miles per dollar spent on purchases (and more on travel booked through Capital One’s travel booking site). Those 750,000 miles would be worth $7,500 when redeemed directly for travel purchases or potentially even more by leveraging the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/capital-one-transfer-partners/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">program’s various airline and hotel transfer partners</a>.</p>
<p>So, whether you earn your Capital One miles like Brian does with his Venture X Business card or with one of Capital One’s other stellar cards, such as the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-venture-x-rewards-credit-card/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card</a> or the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-venture/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</a>, here are 15 dream-worthy ways to spend them.</p>
<h2>Beaches and big cities in Colombia</h2>

<p>Travel from the Washington, D.C., area to this South American gem for a gorgeous mix of culture and beach time — all possible using your Capital One miles in a few great, different ways.</p>
<p>If convenience is what you’re after, you could redeem miles directly through <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-travel-portal/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Capital One’s travel booking site</a> at a rate of 1 cent apiece for airfare between <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/washington-dulles-airport-united-airlines-terminal-updates/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Dulles International Airport (IAD)</a> near Washington (and enjoy <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/capital-one-lounge-washington-dulles-iad-first-look/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">IAD’s Capital One Lounge</a> thanks to the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-venture-x-business/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Capital One Venture X Business card</a>) and mountainous Bogota’s El Dorado International Airport (BOG) or beachy Cartagena’s Rafael Núñez International Airport (CTG) starting at around $400 or 40,000 miles for economy on various airlines, including American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.</p>
<p>Or, you could transfer Capital One miles on a 1:1 basis to <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/everything-you-need-to-know-avianca-lifemiles/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Avianca LifeMiles</a>, the frequent flyer program of Colombian airline Avianca. Instead of paying around $650 for an itinerary from Washington to Cartagena and returning from Bogota, you would need just 16,320 miles plus $138 in taxes and fees in our test searches, which is some pretty terrific savings.</p>
<p>In Bogota, you could put your miles to use by transferring them to <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/choice-privileges/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Choice Privileges</a> at a 1:1 rate so you can redeem 12,000 of them per night (instead of paying around $120) to stay at the upscale Radisson Bogota Metrotel in the city’s tony Chapinero district, where some of Bogota’s best boutiques and restaurants are.</p>
<p>Then it’s off to sunny Cartagena, where you might want to splurge on a stay at the historic Sofitel Legend Santa Clara Cartagena, housed in a magnificent former convent from the 17th century. Room rates there start at around $349 per night. You can save some money, though, by transferring Capital One miles to <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/accor-live-limitless/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Accor Live Limitless</a> at a 2:1 ratio and then redeeming them in parcels of 1,000 points for 20 euros ($22) off your stay.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could just book through Capital One’s travel booking site and redeem your miles at 1 cent apiece for a stay at Casa Pestagua, a Relais &amp; Chateaux-affiliated boutique hotel in the historic city center with rooms starting at around $420 (or 42,000 miles) per night. It is part of the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/hotel/capital-one-premier-collection/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Capital One Premier Collection</a>, so those with Venture X Business cards are eligible to book and receive perks like availability-based upgrades, free daily breakfast for two and up to $100 in statement credits for on-property charges.</p>
<p>It might depend on how many travelers are with you and how long your trip is, but you can turn around 100,000 Capital One miles into a fabulous adventure of at least five to six days.</p>
<h2>(White) Lotus pose</h2>
<p>Think set-jetting is just for the glitterati? Think again.</p>
<p>You can visit one of the tropical Thai islands, where <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/hotel/white-lotus-thailand-dupes/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Season Three of “The White Lotus”</a> was filmed, while sticking to a budget — and your miles can help. When there is award availability, you could transfer just 84,000 Capital One miles to <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/ultimate-guide-singapore-krisflyer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Singapore KrisFlyer</a> and book a round-trip ticket in economy on Singapore Airlines from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) or San Francisco International Airport (SFO) to Phuket International Airport (HKT). Instead of paying $900 in cash, you’d be on the hook for only $65 in taxes and fees, plus the miles spent.</p>
<p>Once there, you could use Capital One miles transferred to <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/ultimate-guide-wyndham-rewards/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Wyndham Rewards</a> to book a stay at the seaside Wyndham Grand Phuket Kalim Bay for just 12,000 points per night (instead of around $150 in cash).</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could stay at one of the actual filming locations for “The White Lotus,” <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/hotel/anantara-mai-khao-phuket-villas-review/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Anantara Mai Khao Phuket Villas</a>, which is part of Capital One’s Premier Collection, for just under $300 per night and enjoy all of those Premier Collection perks. By booking via Capital One’s travel booking site, you’d earn 10 miles per dollar spent on your stay, or you could redeem miles directly for the stay at a rate of 1 cent apiece.</p>
<h2>Jet-set to Europe in Lufthansa’s new business class</h2>
<figure id=""attachment_1801252"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1801252"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1801252"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/Lufthansa-Allegris-Business-Class-Kabine-scaled-1.jpg"" alt=""Lufthansa-Allegris-Business-Class-Kabine-scaled-1"" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1801252"" class=""wp-caption-text"">LUFTHANSA</figcaption></figure>
<p>Lufthansa is currently rolling out its stellar new <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/lufthansa-allegris-us-service/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Allegris business class</a>, with lots of customized <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/lufthansa-allegris-first-flight-review/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">individual seat types</a>, even in the same cabin. (Some are better for colleagues or companions traveling together, while others are great for solo business travelers.) You could take that next business (or leisure) trip in style and arrive rested.</p>
<p>This new business-class seat is flying between Munich and Chicago, San Diego and San Francisco (plus Charlotte starting in August). Be one of the first aviation aficionados (AvGeeks) to experience this stylish new cabin for yourself. You just need to transfer Capital One miles to <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/air-canada-aeroplan/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Air Canada Aeroplan</a>, and all it takes is just 70,000 miles each way between (most of) the U.S. and Munich when awards are available. Taxes and fees can be up to $400 in each direction, but tickets can cost upward of $8,000 if paying with cash, so you are still getting to experience all that luxury at a discount thanks to using your miles.</p>
<h2>A grand time in Grand Cayman</h2>
<p>Although often a short distance, flights between U.S. airports and Grand Cayman can be expensive — typically over $400 round-trip from many airports, but more often in the $700-$800 range.</p>
<p>However, you can save a small fortune and take the whole family (or a group of colleagues as an incentive) to the Caribbean paradise from 24,000 <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/ultimate-ba-avios-guide/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">British Airways Avios</a> (transferred from Capital One on a 1:1 basis) plus around $114 in taxes and fees per round-trip ticket from Miami International Airport (MIA) or 36,000 Avios plus the same taxes and fees from Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). Both options are for flights operated by American Airlines.</p>
<p>Once there, you can spend your days scuba diving, sunning on Seven Mile Beach and swimming with manta rays.</p>
<h2>Magic in the Maasai Mara</h2>
<figure id=""attachment_1801323"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1801323"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1801323"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/Leopard-perched-on-a-tree-out-in-the-open-with-a-safari-tour-in-the-background-in-the-Maasai-Mara-plains-Kenya-Africa_Philip-Thurston.jpg"" alt=""Leopard perched on a tree out in the open with a safari tour in the background"" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1801323"" class=""wp-caption-text"">A leopard perched on a tree out in the open with a safari tour in the background in the Maasai Mara plains in Kenya. PHILLIP THURSTON/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>
<p>Want to consider a true splurge?</p>
<p>You could transfer Capital One miles to <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/great-value-virgin-atlantic-flying-club/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Virgin Red</a> and redeem them for a no-expense-spared stay at one of Sir Richard Branson’s safari lodges in Africa. Mahali Mzuri is a lavish camp in Kenya’s wildlife-rich Maasai Mara National Reserve. There, you can redeem Virgin Red points for stays starting at two nights for 330,000 points (extra nights start at 165,000 points).</p>
<p>That’s a lot of points, but it sure beats paying common rates of nearly $3,000 per night! Plus, if you earn the Venture X Business <span style=""color: #ff00ff;"">card’s</span> full welcome offer of up to 350,000 miles — 150,000 miles after spending $30,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening and an additional 200,000 miles after spending $200,000 on purchases in the first six months from account opening — you’ll have more than enough miles for a memorable safari.</p>
<p>Yes, those spending requirements may sound high, but if your small business can use a credit card for the majority of its expenses, these numbers might be more within reach than you think.</p>
<h2>Splurge on Spain</h2>
<p>Capital One miles convert to British Airways Avios at a 1:1 rate, making it possible to transfer miles to British Airways Club partner Club Iberia Plus to redeem for Iberia flights. Why the double transfer? Great question.</p>
<p>It’s because with Club Iberia Plus, business-class award tickets on off-peak dates (think: during the fall and winter when most folks aren’t traveling) can cost as low as <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/iberia-sweet-spot-off-peak-europe/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">34,000 Avios each way</a> from airports like New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) to Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport (MAD) and Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport (BCN), so you are getting to Europe in style at a steep discount.</p>
<p>If headed to Barcelona, check out the all-new, swanky SLS hotel by the Marina (it just opened April 1), where room rates start at around $250 per night — but you can shave some dollars off that price by converting Capital One miles to Accor Live Limitless points and redeeming them in batches of 1,000 points for 20 euros ($22) in value off your hotel bill.</p>
<h2>Yay for Cathay</h2>
<p>One of the most exclusive ways to fly is in Hong Kong-based airline <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/airline/reviews/cathay-pacific-777-first-class/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Cathay Pacific’s decadent first class</a> between Hong Kong and the U.S.</p>
<p>Although award availability is extremely difficult (if not sometimes impossible) to come by when trying to use partner miles, Capital One miles actually transfer on a 1:1 basis directly to Cathay Pacific’s own <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/cathay-pacific-asia-miles/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Asia Miles program</a>. There, award availability is much better; all you need is 125,000 Asia Miles (plus about $150-$180 in taxes and fees) in each direction to experience nearly 15 hours of luxury, including caviar courses and free-flowing fine Champagne, when traveling between Los Angeles and Hong Kong.</p>
<h2>Aloha, Hawaii</h2>
<figure id=""attachment_1801326"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1801326"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1801326"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/Hawaiian-Family-Fishing-from-the-cliffs-at-Kaena-Point-State-Park-in-Oahu-Hawaii_-ferrantraite.jpg"" alt=""Hawaiian Family Fishing at Ka'ena Point in Oahu"" width=""1600"" height=""1066"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1801326"" class=""wp-caption-text"">Kaena Point State Park in Oahu, Hawaii. FERRANTRAITE/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/all-about-turkish-miles-smiles/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Turkish Miles&amp;Smiles</a> is a 1:1 Capital One airline transfer partner, and one of the all-time-best award chart sweet spots anywhere, when available, is redeeming just 10,000 Turkish Airlines miles each way for domestic economy award tickets within the U.S., <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/points-and-miles-to-hawaii/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">including to Hawaii</a>, on its Star Alliance partner, United Airlines.</p>
<p>That’s a fraction of what other programs will charge you and means you could (again, if you can find the availability) book 10 people round-trip tickets to the islands from the U.S. mainland with the 350,000-mile welcome offer from the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-venture-x-business/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Venture X Business card</a> &#8230; and still have 150,000 miles left over!</p>
<p>Math can be fun. Perhaps this is just the opportunity you need to reward some high-performing colleagues for their hard work and to make the folks back home jealous with your real Zoom background of sandy beaches and crashing waves.</p>
<h2>Put the vacay in Vacasa</h2>
<p>Thanks to Wyndham Rewards’ <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/redeem-wyndham-rewards-for-vacasa/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">partnership with Vacasa vacation rentals</a>, you can redeem Wyndham Rewards points at a rate of either 15,000 or 30,000 points per bedroom, per night for some fabulous vacation rentals around the world.</p>
<p>The 350,000-mile welcome offer from the Venture X Business card would be enough for as many as 23 nights in a one-bedroom condo near some fabulous beaches and golf courses in Los Cabos, Mexico, or 11 nights in a stunning two-bedroom suite at any number of beach resorts perched on the jungle-covered mountainsides around Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.</p>
<h2>Like Europe, but closer</h2>
<figure id=""attachment_1505541"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1505541"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1505541"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2023/06/Quebec-City-skyline-in-summer_Posnov.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1505541"" class=""wp-caption-text"">POSNOV/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>
<p>Feel like a European getaway but don’t have the time for a full-blown transatlantic jaunt?</p>
<p>Try a visit to Quebec City this summer instead. Thanks to its zone- and distance-based award chart, Air Canada Aeroplan only requires as few as 6,000 miles each way, making it possible to get from Boston or New York City to Quebec City on Air Canada or United for as few as 12,000 miles round-trip instead of paying around $500.</p>
<p>That means you’ll have more miles to put toward your hotel stay at options like the boutique Hotel Royal William, Ascend Collection, which is part of Choice Privileges. Rates there start at 20,000 points per night (instead of around $250).</p>
<p>Or, you could live it up at the historic <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/hotel/reviews/fairmont-le-chateau-frontenac-review/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Fairmont Le Chateau Frontenac</a>, which started welcoming guests in 1893 and was one of the original grand railway hotels. It has hosted heads of state and royals ever since and happens to be part of Accor Live Limitless, so you can transfer Capital One miles to the program on a 2:1 basis to help bring the cost of your stay down.</p>
<h2>Colorado highs and South Carolina Lowcountry</h2>
<p>With the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-venture-x-business/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Venture X Business card</a>, you have access to both Premier Collection and <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/capital-one-lifestyle-collection/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Lifestyle Collection</a> vacation rentals bookable through Capital One’s travel booking site, making it possible to stay in gorgeous locales like Aspen, Colorado, and Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
<p>Premier Collection and Lifestyle Collection rentals earn 5 miles per dollar spent on the booking, and you can redeem your Capital One miles for 1 cent apiece toward the cost. To think about it another way, if you hit the minimum spending requirement needed to earn the full 350,000-mile welcome offer (that’s a total of $200,000 on purchases in the first six months from opening your account) on the Venture X Business card, you’d have a total of 750,000 miles.</p>
<p>That’s enough to offset $7,500 in expenses on a rental on lush Kiawah Island, a Lowcountry destination less than an hour away from Charleston that’s known for its beaches and great golfing, or a mountainside chalet in Aspen, which you could make your home base for a ski vacation in winter or a hiking adventure in summer.</p>
<h2>Have a g’day Down Under</h2>
<figure id=""attachment_1801327"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1801327"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1801327"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/Group-of-people-snorkelling-on-the-Ningaloo-Reef-in-Exmouth-Western-Australia_-Abstract-Aerial-Art.jpg"" alt=""Group of people snorkeling on the Ningaloo Reef located in Exmouth, Western Australia.

ABSTRACT AERIAL ART/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>
<p>Most folks think the major expense of a trip to Australia is the cost of just flying there.</p>
<p>However, once you get to the continent, domestic flights can also add up to become a large portion of your trip cost. That’s why it might make sense to convert Capital One miles to British Airways Avios and redeem them for otherwise costly short flights on the carrier’s Oneworld partner, Qantas (which is also a Capital One transfer partner, but its redemption rates are often not as advantageous).</p>
<p>Instead of paying about $300 for a flight from Melbourne to Cairns, one of the gateways to the Great Barrier Reef, you could spend just 11,000 Avios plus around $70 in taxes and fees when awards are available.</p>
<p>Want to fly from Perth up to Exmouth so you can swim with whale sharks along Ningaloo Reef? Those flights can cost around $1,100 round-trip. Fortunately, you only need a minimum of 18,000 Avios round-trip to cover the journey thanks to British Airways Club’s distance-based redemptions on partners. That can amount to massive savings and open up otherwise inaccessible destinations Down Under.</p>
<h2>Say &#8216;Sawubona&#8217; to South Africa</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to watch the clouds roll down the golden sandstone face of Table Mountain as the sun rises over Cape Town, your best bet for getting there might just be transferring Capital One miles to Avianca LifeMiles. Then, you can redeem them for award tickets on Avianca’s Star Alliance partner, United.</p>
<p>It will cost you at least 55,000 miles each way in economy or 90,000 miles in business class between the carrier’s hubs at <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/newark-airport-vision-plan-new-terminal/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR)</a> and IAD to Cape Town International Airport (CPT). From there, you can explore the beauty of South Africa’s rugged coast, venture inland to taste the vintages in the Cape Winelands or just spend a few days on the beach before heading out on safari elsewhere in the country or region.</p>
<h2>Collect some fancy Delft houses on KLM</h2>
<figure id=""attachment_1695991"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1695991"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1695991"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2024/08/20240814_KLM-New-Business-Class_KLM-777-new-biz-Delft-houses-1_ERosen_179.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1695991"" class=""wp-caption-text"">ERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Among AvGeeks, one of the airline souvenirs of lore is <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/klm-delft-house-2023/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">KLM’s famous Delft houses</a>, which the Dutch airline hands out as parting gifts to business-class flyers.</p>
<p>There’s one adorable miniature building design created for every year of the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/klm-delft-house-reveal-2024/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">airline’s 105-year history</a> &#8230; so we dare you to try to collect them all! The good news is that you’ll need just 60,000 Capital One miles transferred to <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/ultimate-guide-flying-blue/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Air France-KLM Flying Blue</a> when available (instead of anywhere from $3,000 to $9,000) to fly between several U.S. airports and the airline’s hub in Amsterdam in order to pick up the next Delft house in your collection. Just be aware of taxes and fees on award tickets; they cost around $200 to $300 each way.</p>
<p><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/airline/reviews/klm-business-class-new/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">While on board</a>, expect the airline’s signature amenities, including reverse-herringbone seats (some of which come with closing privacy panels), gourmet menus courtesy of famous Dutch chefs and functional amenity kits stocked with Marie-Stella-Maris skincare products. Once you have your tiny house in hand, you could spend part of your European sojourn actually trekking to the historical building in the Netherlands upon which it was based.</p>
<h2>A sweet spot in ANA’s The Suite</h2>
<p>Along with <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/airline/ana-the-room-business-class/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">business-class suites called The Room,</a> Japanese airline All Nippon Airways introduced all-new first-class fixtures dubbed The Suite back in 2019, and they remain among the most luxurious ways to fly in the world.</p>
<p>Aircraft equipped with cabins featuring The Suite have just eight of them aboard in a small cabin up front that features two rows of four seats, each in a 1-2-1 pattern. Designed by famed Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, The Suite has a muted palette inspired by Japanese luxury hotels, as well as up-to-the-minute tech features like 43-inch entertainment monitors. Passengers can also count on both Japanese and Western meals from Michelin-lauded chefs while on board.</p>
<p>Although award availability is hard to come by, when it does pop up, you can take advantage by transferring Capital One miles to Virgin Red and then redeeming 72,500 of them each way between the western U.S. and Japan or 85,000 Virgin Red points each way between the eastern U.S. and Japan.</p>
<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<figure id=""attachment_1801330"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1801330"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1801330"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/20250506_Capital-One-Venture-X-Business-SponCon_C1_BCP_IMG_PROF_CARD_8005-copy.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1801330"" class=""wp-caption-text"">CAPITAL ONE</figcaption></figure>
<p>With the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-venture-x-business/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Capital One Venture X Business</a> card, the opportunities to earn Capital One miles on everyday purchases and travel-specific ones are nearly endless. So, too, are the potential chances to redeem them for fantastic trips around the world — for work or fun — thanks to the versatility of Capital One miles and the program’s many airline and hotel partners.</p>

JetBlue Plus Card review: A rewarding credit card for JetBlue fans,https://thepointsguy.com/guide/credit-card-review-jetblue-plus-card/,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 13:30:24 +0000",Ryan Wilcox,Airlines,"<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This is a recurring post, regularly updated with new information and offers.</em></p>
<h2>JetBlue Plus Card overview</h2>
<p>The JetBlue Plus Card offers a terrific return on airfare spending and comes with multiple perks. Benefits such as an anniversary points bonus, free checked baggage allowance, 10% of your points back on award redemptions and annual JetBlue Vacations statement credit make this card worthwhile, even for occasional travelers. <strong>Card rating*: ⭐⭐⭐⭐</strong></p>

<hr />
<p>JetBlue’s loyalty program, <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/jetblue-trueblue-program/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">TrueBlue</a>, has flown under the radar over the years, as redemptions were largely restricted to flights operated by JetBlue and Hawaiian Airlines. However, this has changed in recent years, with Icelandair, TAP Air Portugal and Qatar Airways redemptions being added to TrueBlue. Plus, JetBlue is known for its excellent <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/airline/jetblue-mint-suites-paris/"">Mint business-class product</a> and extensive East Coast and Caribbean route network.</p>
<p>If you are a JetBlue flyer and want to boost your TrueBlue balance or elevate your flying experience with the airline, you should consider the JetBlue Plus Card. The card offers several valuable perks that help justify its $99 annual fee.</p>
<p>First, note that you’ll want to have a “good” <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/how-credit-scores-work/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">credit score</a> (670 or above) for the best chances of approval. Now, let’s dig into the card specifics.</p>

<h2>JetBlue Plus Card welcome offer</h2>
<p>New JetBlue Plus cardholders can earn 60,000 points after spending $1,000 on purchases and paying the annual fee in full within the first 90 days.</p>
<p>Based on our June 2025 <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/monthly-valuations/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">valuation</a> of JetBlue TrueBlue points at 1.35 cents per point, that’s a value of $810.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1604442"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 1600px;"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1604442"">

<p>This is not the best offer we’ve seen on this card, but it&#8217;s a solid value for the annual fee, especially if you&#8217;re a JetBlue loyalist.</p>

<h2>JetBlue Plus Card benefits</h2>
<p>In addition to a high return on JetBlue spending, there’s a ton of value in the benefits offered by the JetBlue Plus Card. The perks mostly revolve around JetBlue, but even occasional flyers should be able to take full advantage of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Annual JetBlue Vacations statement credit</strong>: Get a $100 statement credit every year with your purchase of a JetBlue Vacations package of $100 or more with your card.</li>
<li><strong>Fast-track Mosaic status</strong>: Get automatic <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/what-is-jetblue-elite-status-worth/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Mosaic status</a> after spending $50,000 on the card in a calendar year.</li>
<li><strong>Free first checked bag</strong>: When you purchase a ticket on a JetBlue-operated flight with your card, you and up to three companions on the same reservation can check your first bag for free.</li>
<li><strong>No foreign transaction fees</strong></li>
<li><b>Points Payback: </b>You can redeem points for a statement credit of up to $1,000 annually.</li>
<li><strong>10% back on award flights</strong>: When you redeem TrueBlue points for a JetBlue flight, you’ll earn 10% of those points back after you take the flight.</li>
<li><strong>50% inflight savings</strong>: Get 50% back on eligible inflight purchases on JetBlue-operated flights, including alcoholic drinks and food. This discount is applied automatically, generally on the day the charge is posted to your card account.</li>
<li><strong>5,000-point anniversary bonus</strong>: These points are worth about $68 according to our June 2025 <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/monthly-valuations/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">valuations</a>, so without setting foot on a JetBlue plane, you’re covering more than two-thirds of the card’s $99 annual fee.</li>
</ul>
<figure id=""attachment_1213472"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 1600px;"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1213472"">

<p>Aside from the JetBlue-specific perks, cardholders will receive <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/travel-insurance/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">travel</a> and <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/best-cards-purchase-protection/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">purchase protections</a>, as well as other everyday perks via this card being a <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/world-elite-vs-world-mastercard/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">World Elite Mastercard</a>. Here are a few that stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trip cancellation and interruption coverage</strong>: Get up to $5,000 back in nonrefundable expenses per trip ($10,000 maximum per 12-month period) if you need to cancel or interrupt a trip for a covered reason.</li>
<li><strong>Trip delay protection</strong>: Get up to $300 per trip if your flight is delayed more than six hours (maximum of twice in a 12-month period)</li>

<h2>Earning points on the JetBlue Plus Card</h2>
<p>On the earning side, this card outdoes many cobranded cards from airlines and even some cards that <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/guide/a-guide-to-earning-transferable-points/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">earn transferable points</a>.</p>
<p>With this card, you’ll earn 6 points per dollar spent on eligible purchases with JetBlue and Paisly (JetBlue&#8217;s travel booking platform), 2 points per dollar spent <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/dining/"">at restaurants</a> and eligible <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/grocery/"">grocery stores</a>, and 1 point per dollar spent on <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/everyday-spending/"">all other purchases</a>.</p>
<p>By comparison, the no-annual-fee version of this card offers half as many points on JetBlue purchases.</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that as a TrueBlue member, you’ll earn at least 2 base points per dollar spent on JetBlue flights booked directly on top of the 6 points per dollar you’ll earn through the card.</p>

<h2>Redeeming JetBlue TrueBlue points</h2>
<p>The TrueBlue loyalty program is revenue-based for JetBlue-operated flights, so redemptions are very straightforward. You can redeem points for any seat, including Mint seats, on any JetBlue flight across its entire route network and get a fairly consistent value from your points.</p>
<p>The more a flight costs in cash, the more it costs in points, and vice versa.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1484627"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 1600px;"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1484627"">

<p>JetBlue holds somewhat frequent <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/jetblue-big-spring-sale/"">flash sales</a>. Often, flights start at $20 one-way and can be booked for a measly 400 points. The positive is that you won’t have to worry about scouring for saver award availability.</p>
<p>However, it also means there aren’t any major sweet spots for long-haul international first class.<b></b></p>
<p><strong>Related: <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/jetblue-points-for-blue-basic/"">JetBlue now allows Blue Basic award redemptions — and tickets are as low as 700 points</a></strong></p>
<h2>Redeeming TrueBlue points on partner airlines</h2>
<p>JetBlue partners with a handful of other carriers. You can redeem TrueBlue points with Cape Air, Etihad Airways, Hawaiian Airlines, Icelandair, Japan Airlines, Qatar Airways and TAP Air Portugal. Redeeming TrueBlue points with these partners, especially Qatar and Icelandair, can often yield solid redemption value.</p>
<p>For example, you can redeem 89,000 TrueBlue points for a business-class flight from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) to Tokyo&#8217;s Narita International Airport (NRT) on many dates. Similar prices exist for Qatar Airways and Icelandair international business-class award tickets.</p>

<p>Plus, JetBlue announced in May 2025 that it&#8217;s <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/united-airlines-jetblue-partnership/"">launching a partnership</a> between TrueBlue and United Airlines MileagePlus called Blue Sky. This collaboration will allow members to earn and redeem miles between the two loyalty programs.</p>

<h2>Which cards compete with the JetBlue Plus Card?</h2>
<p>Here’s a side-by-side look at three of the card’s mid-tier travel competitors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you prefer no annual fee:</strong> The JetBlue Card earns 3 points per dollar spent on eligible JetBlue and Paisly purchases, 2 points per dollar spent at restaurants and eligible grocery stores, and 1 point per dollar spent on everything else. It offers a 50% discount on inflight purchases on JetBlue-operated flights and has no annual fee. To learn more, read our <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/reviews/jetblue-card-review/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">full review of the JetBlue Card</a>.</li>
<li><strong>If you prefer Capital One</strong>: The <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-venture/"">Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</a> provides 5 miles per dollar spent on hotels, vacation rentals and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel, and 2 miles per dollar spent on all other purchases for a reasonable $95 annual fee. To learn more, read our <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/reviews/capital-one-venture-card-review/"">full review of the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</a>.</li>
<li><strong>If you prefer Chase</strong>: For a $95 annual fee on the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/apply-now/chase-sapphire-preferred-card/?tid=post"">Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card</a> (see <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/apply/chase-sapphire-preferred-card-rates-and-fees/?tid=post"">rates and fees</a>), you’ll earn 5 points per dollar spent on travel booked through Chase Travel℠, 3 points per dollar spent on dining (including eligible delivery services and takeout) and 2 points per dollar spent on all travel not booked through Chase Travel, and 1 point on all other purchases.

<h2>Is the JetBlue Plus Card worth it?</h2>
<p>No other mid-tier cards come close to the JetBlue Plus Card when it comes to a return on JetBlue spending or benefits. However, those who aren’t able to fly JetBlue regularly may not get enough value from this card to justify the annual fee.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>Even if you only fly JetBlue occasionally, you’ll make up for more than two-thirds of the JetBlue Plus Card’s annual fee by taking advantage of the 5,000-point anniversary bonus alone. With the additional JetBlue perks like the free checked bag and savings on inflight purchases, JetBlue flyers will almost certainly benefit from this card.</p>
<p>However, if you don’t think you would benefit from the higher earning rates or perks, you might want to stick to the no-annual-fee JetBlue Card.</p>

Looking back at the things that didn’t exist when TPG started,https://thepointsguy.com/news/things-that-didnt-exist-when-tpg-started/,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 13:00:08 +0000",Lyndsey Matthews,News,"<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: TPG founder Brian Kelly is a Bilt adviser and investor.</em></p>
<p><span>When TPG founder Brian Kelly published his first blog post June 7, 2010, Continental Airlines and the original Starwood Hotels were still around. But many other things we take for granted about traveling today didn’t exist 15 years ago. </span></p>
<p><span>Key developments in the loyalty and travel industries, like issuer-branded airport lounges and most premium credit cards, have all happened since Brian wrote his first-ever story. Let’s look at how the travel landscape has changed since TPG started.</span></p>
<h2><span>6-figure card bonus offers become more common</span></h2>
<p><b>When</b>: <span>March 2011</span></p>
<p><span>When TPG started, credit card bonuses were much smaller and generally fell within the 25,000- to 50,000-point range. That changed in March 2011, when Capital One launched a bonus of up to 110,000 points (it has since changed the currency to miles) on the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-venture/"">Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</a> as part of a &#8220;Match Your Miles&#8221; promotion (no longer available). </span></p>
<p><span>The following month, airline credit cards followed when Chase’s <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/british-airways-visa-signature-card/"">British Airways Visa Signature® Card</a> launched a 100,000-mile bonus (no longer available). (That program has also changed its currency from miles to Avios.)</span></p>
<h2><span>Airlines add spending requirements for elite status qualification</span></h2>
<p><b>When</b>: <span>January 2013</span></p>
<p><span>At the beginning of 2013, Delta Air Lines was the first major airline to </span><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/delta-officially-confirms-new-revenue-based-medallion-program/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span>add a revenue component</span></a><span> to qualify for elite status, in addition to miles or segments flown. (We now know this as Medallion Qualification Dollars.) United Airlines followed suit not long after in June 2013. The third major domestic airline, American Airlines, </span><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/news/aadvantage-revenue-based-changes/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span>didn’t make this change until 2016</span></a><span>.</span></p>

Plus, new cardholders will receive a 30% flight discount code for a qualifying future flight after account opening.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Or, with the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/apply-now/alaska-airlines-visa-business-credit-card/?tid=post"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Alaska Airlines Visa® Business card</a>, new cardholders can earn 60,000 bonus miles and Alaska&#8217;s Famous Companion Fare™ ($99 fare, plus taxes and fees from $23) after making $4,000 or more in purchases within the first 90 days of opening an account.</p>

<p>You can also transfer American Express Membership Rewards points to Mileage Plan via the HawaiianMiles program; however, <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/airline/amex-transfers-hawaiian-airlines-end-june-30/"">this will end June 30</a>.</p>
<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>Alaska’s latest Global Getaways promotion has discounted redemptions to interesting destinations across North America, Europe, Asia and South America.</p>
<p>While the travel window and the restriction that travel must commence in the U.S. are limiting, there are still good deals to be had. Remember to book by June 30 to take advantage of this offer.</p>

<p><span>The </span><a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/card-hub/ramp-business-card/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ramp Business Card</a><span> makes the most sense for corporations, limited liability companies, and limited partnerships seeking a no-annual-fee, streamlined solution for expense management.</span> However, factors like a lack of a welcome bonus and no elevated reward rates in business-specific categories place the Ramp Card at the back of the pack when compared to other business cards on the market. <strong>Card Rating*: ⭐⭐⭐½</strong></p>
<h6 style=""text-align: center;""><em>*<a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/review-methodology/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Card rating</a> is based on the opinion of TPG’s editors and is not influenced by the card issuer.</em></h6>

<p>Business owners looking for a straightforward way to track their <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/guide-to-applying-small-business-credit-cards/"">business</a> expenses without shelling out for an annual fee may benefit from holding the <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/card-hub/ramp-business-card/"">Ramp Card</a>. This corporate charge card is a bit different from some business credit cards in that it requires the balance to be paid in full each billing cycle instead of allowing cardholders to carry a balance.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">To qualify for the Ramp Card, your enterprise must be registered in the U.S. and have a physical U.S.-based address (note that P.O. boxes, virtual addresses and mail-forwarding addresses do not qualify). Additionally, though Ramp does allow international transactions, most of your business operations and related spending should occur stateside.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Finally, your business must be a corporation, an LLC or an LP to qualify for the Ramp Card. Individuals, sole proprietors and other unregistered businesses do not qualify for this product.</span></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/card-hub/ramp-business-card/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ramp Card</a> is part of the Ramp finance operations platform, which features integrated software to help manage business spending across all cards issued to your enterprise.</p>
<p>One great feature of this card is that you can get an unlimited number of employee cards — both virtual and physical — for free. This also enables you or a designated account manager to supervise and control individual and company-wide spending. The Ramp Card also provides access to real-time spend data.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1494314"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1494314"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1494314"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2023/05/Man-using-computer-at-home-office_Morsa-Images.jpg"" alt=""Man using a computer at home"" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1494314"" class=""wp-caption-text"">MORSA IMAGES/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ramp software allows you to control which preapproved merchants your employees can make purchases at and set spend limits as needed. Those seeking a one-size-fits-all platform where they can manage all the financial aspects of their business spending can enjoy Ramp&#8217;s one-stop shop approach.</p>
<p><strong>Related: <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/credit-score-business-cards/"">What credit score do you need for business credit cards?</a></strong></p>
<p>Ramp helps you automate expense tracking and even reimbursement for instances when your employees make business-related purchases with a non-Ramp card.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Ramp Card doesn&#8217;t require a personal guarantee. This means that if your business (as its own entity) isn&#8217;t able to pay the debt accrued on the card, you as an individual are not liable for that debt.</p>
<h2 id=""earning"">Earning cash back with the Ramp Card</h2>
<p>The <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/card-hub/ramp-business-card/"">Ramp Card</a> earns up to 1.5% cash back on all spending, which can be lucrative, especially since there&#8217;s no cap on the amount of cash back you can earn.</p>
<h2 id=""redeeming"">Redeeming cash back with the Ramp Card</h2>
<p>You can redeem your <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/card-hub/ramp-business-card/"">Ramp Card</a> cash back as a statement credit or Ramp Plus payment (for those who are subscribed to this optional, paid platform), transfer it to airline and hotel loyalty programs or put it toward gift cards.</p>
<p>Ramp offers <a href=""https://support.ramp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042590134-How-to-use-cashback-rewards"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">step-by-step instructions on redeeming your cash-back</a> rewards across the options listed above.</p>
<h2>Transferring rewards with the Ramp Card</h2>
<p>If you want to use your <a href=""https://thepointsguy.com/card-hub/ramp-business-card/"">Ramp Card</a> cash back as travel reward currency, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, the loyalty program member ID needs to be identical to your name within Ramp&#8217;s system.</p>
<p>For example, if your name in Ramp&#8217;s system is &#8220;Elizabeth Smith&#8221; and your member ID for an airline loyalty program is &#8220;Liz Smith,&#8221; you will not be able to convert your Ramp cash back into airline miles.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_1788370"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-1788370"" style=""width: 1600px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1788370"" src=""https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/04/Couple-at-airport-together-taking-photos-of-planes-from-airport-gate_SolStock.jpg"" alt=""couple at an airport together ready to go on holiday"" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-1788370"" class=""wp-caption-text"">SOLSTOCK/GETTY IMAGES</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, select the loyalty program you want to transfer your cash back to, type out the member ID for that loyalty program and then specify the number of points you want to transfer (there&#8217;s a minimum of 100 points required each time you make a transfer).</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve designated a set number to transfer, you should see that figure in your loyalty program account within two business days.</p>
<p>As of publish time, TPG hasn&#8217;t been able to confirm what specific travel loyalty programs are transfer partners of the Ramp Card, but some outlets have reported that the list includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air France-KLM Flying Blue</li>
<li>Avianca LifeMiles</li>
<li>British Airways Club</li>
<li>Marriott Bonvoy</li>
<li>Wyndham Rewards</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s reported that all Ramp rewards transfer to partners at a 1.5:1 ratio.</p>

","Ramp Business Card overview The Ramp Business Card makes the most sense for corporations, limited liability companies, and limited partnerships seeking a no-annual-fee, streamlined solution for expense management. However, factors like a lack of a welcome bonus and no elevated reward rates in business-specific categories place the Ramp Card at the back of the pack when compared …",https://thepointsguy.com/?p=1808981,"https://thepointsguy.freetls.fastly.net/us/originals/2018/08/corporate-office-space.jpg?fit=1280,960"

<p>The world is shifting the 9-5 as we know it. AI is threatening job positions, there are layoffs, recessions are looming, and meanwhile, the price of everything is going up.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been saying this for years, but your life experience, your passion, and your skills might be your biggest safety net, and your best opportunity for income going forward.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re <em>not</em> profiting from what you love doing and what you already know, then you could be leaving a lot of potential on the table!</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been huge proponents of starting something of your own — something that&#8217;s yours and can&#8217;t be taken away from you.</p>



<p>This is what we&#8217;ve believed since the start of Goats On The Road — wayyyy back in 2012 (yeah we&#8217;ve been around for awhile!)</p>



<p>But, it&#8217;s especially relevant these days.</p>



<p>The truth is, a lot of what we used to rely on — stable jobs, steady income, predictable growth — feels pretty shaky right now.</p>



<p>But, don&#8217;t worry,<strong> it&#8217;s not all doom and gloom</strong>! There&#8217;s a way for you to overcome these challenges, which is what I&#8217;ll get into in this article.</p>







<p>Most people think they need more <em>credentials</em> to start an online brand. And actually, this is where most people get stuck —spending time on certifications, waiting until they have a bigger following, and taking more courses to learn <em>more </em>about the topic that they already know!</p>

<p><strong>But the truth is:</strong></p>



<p>You’re already sitting on something people would pay to learn — you just don’t realize how valuable it is (yet)!</p>



<p>We’ve helped more than a thousand people start online brands around their passions, skills and experiences, based on what they <em>already know</em>.</p>



<p>Meaning, they didn&#8217;t have to spend tons of time adding more to their plate&#8230;we simply helped them unpack the gold that was already there.</p>



<p>Your niche. Your amazing idea. Your next move…it’s found inside your skills, your experiences, and your passions.</p>



<p>If you’re thinking about creating something of your own (as a side hustle, or as a full-time gig), and are looking to turn your expertise into profit, this is where to start.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re unsure about <a href=""https://learn.goatsontheroad.com/niche-clarity-course/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">what niche to pick</a> or what kind of business to start, here’s the framework we&#8217;ve personally used to come up with our profitable ideas over the years, and it&#8217;s what we teach our clients as well.</p>



<p>It’s built on 3 &#8216;buckets&#8217; that we all have access to — no matter your background, job title, or level of experience. </p>



<p><em>Note: we go deeper into this and really help you narrow down your idea in our <a href=""https://learn.goatsontheroad.com/niche-clarity-course/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Niche Clarity Program</a></em>.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Bucket #1:</strong> Skills &amp; Knowledge</h2>



<p>This is the knowledge you’ve accumulated over the years. Skills you&#8217;ve learned through your career, school, certifications, training, self-education&#8230;or even just trial and error. </p>



<p>You might not think of it as special, because it comes naturally to you now. But to someone else, it’s exactly what they need help with. </p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Here are a few examples:</h3>



<p>Maybe you&#8217;ve&#8230;</p>



<ol class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Mastered Excel spreadsheets, and you’ve built custom templates that save hours every week. </li>



<li>Become an expert in designing logos, editing resumes, or organizing digital files.</li>



<li>Figured out how to run a profitable Airbnb </li>



<li>Cracked the code on how to grow a YouTube channel. </li>



<li>Figured out a productive workflow and how to repurpose one video into a week’s worth of content.</li>



<li>Been (or currently are) a project manager, realtor, professional chef. </li>



<li>Been certified for teaching, coaching, being a personal trainer, or a yoga instructor.</li>



<li>Mastered data entry, bookkeeping, or using accounting software like QuickBooks.</li>



<li>Trained new team members and loved breaking down complex tasks into simple steps.</li>



<li>Ran internal events, team-building activities, or even organized office potlucks — and people saw you as the &#8220;glue.&#8221;</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these skills, all of this knowledge that you have, can all be turned into your own business. It&#8217;s just taking what you already do and already know, and deciding that you want to create something of your own. </p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Here are a few real-life examples from our clients:</h3>



<ol class=""wp-block-list"">
<li><strong>Self-Made Millionaire and Finance Mentor</strong> turned personal coach to help beginners invest in the stock market and build wealth</li>



<li><strong>Certified Yoga and Breathwork Instructor and Personal Trainer</strong> coaching women in midlife to find physical, emotional and spiritual harmony in the next chapter of their lives.</li>



<li><strong>Real Estate Investor and Landlord</strong> of 15 years coaching new landlords on getting started and manage their properties with confidence</li>
</ol>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Other Examples:</h3>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li><strong>Morgan Overholt</strong> was a burned-out graphic designer and quit her 9-5 to freelance full time and turn her design skills into a $100,000 per year business.</li>



<li><strong>Ali Abdaal</strong> was a doctor who had to use productivity hacks just to survive his demanding work. When he realized other people could use his tools in all areas of life, he quit his job to teach it online and now earns over $4 million per year.</li>



<li><strong>Greg Langstaff</strong> was a career advisor and recruiter who quit his job to teach othe people what not to do when going to job interviews. Now he makes relateable and funny videos on tiktok and now runs a multi-6-figure business offering resume reviews, and selling courses and coaching.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Here’s the thing:</h3>



<p>What you know how to do — whether it’s from your job, your side hustle, or your own curiosity over the years — can become the foundation of your niche.</p>



<p>What feels obvious, easy, or boring to you, could be life-changing to someone else who’s stuck, confused, or overwhelmed. And they just don&#8217;t know where to start.</p>



<p>We see this all the time. People turning everyday skills into businesses — teaching what they already know. You don’t need to learn something new to get started. You just need to learn how to <strong>package what you already know</strong> in a way that helps others.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Bucket #2:</strong> Life Experiences &amp; Your Personal Story</h2>



<p>More often than not, the most powerful business ideas don’t come from a job or a degree — they come from what you’ve lived through&#8230;your story.</p>

<p>For us personally, there are a few key life experiences that we&#8217;ve already turned into profit — and could easily do again.</p>



<p>The biggest one was taking the leap to become entrepreneurs. To be our own boss. We knew we were meant for more and believed there had to be a way to do meaningful work we actually enjoyed.<br><br>And that belief is what draws people to our story — because they feel the same way.</p>



<p>We took our lived experience of building up 4 online brands, and turned it into an impactful, profitable coaching business that helps others do the same.</p>



<p>That’s exactly what we teach inside our Creator Kickstarter Coaching Program. <strong>Your lived experience can become the business you profit from—just like ours did.</strong></p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Other Examples:</h3>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li><strong>Lisa Johnson</strong> was a single mom in the UK, with £35,000 of debt. She got through it and now sells courses and programs teaching other people how to earn income. She&#8217;s now earned over £16 million and has assisted more than 50,000 entrepreneurs.</li>



<li><strong>Nadine Muller</strong> transitioned from a nursing career to becoming a personal fitness trainer, eventually moving into online coaching. By leveraging her experiences and challenges, she built a multimillion-dollar coaching business. </li>



<li><strong>Kiki Ayers</strong> faced homelessness in Los Angeles but utilized her background in entertainment reporting to establish a public relations firm. By sharing her story and experiences, she built a business that generated about $3 million in 2024. </li>
</ul>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Here&#8217;s the thing:</h3>



<p>These life experiences aren’t just personal things that happened <em>to </em>you&#8230;what if they happened <em>for </em>you?</p>



<p>These times in your life are packed with lessons, frameworks, and real-life tools that other people desperately need. It can become a shortcut, a roadmap, or a spark of hope for someone else.</p>



<p>You don’t need to be perfect or polished, you just need to be honest. Not pretending you have it all figured out, but being a few steps ahead and turning your journey into something that helps someone else.</p>



<p>Having an impact and helping others find solutions to their problems is what building a brand is really about.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. Passions &amp; Interests</h2>



<p>Sometimes, your best idea isn’t the thing people would find on your résumé. It&#8217;s not your skills and all the knowledge you&#8217;ve accumulated&#8230;it’s actually the thing you could talk about for hours without getting bored!</p>

Making it? Drinking it? Learning about it?</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It’s the topic that lights you up when someone asks the right question. It’s something you’re always learning more about — not because you have to, but because you actually want to.</p>



<p>Take Nick for example, and his passion is fly-fishing. It&#8217;s something he&#8217;s been doing since he was a kid and would spend weekends out on the lake with his Dad and Brother.</p>



<p>Fly fishing is something that he&#8217;s always learning more about and perfecting. You&#8217;ll find him holed up in his &#8220;mancave&#8221; tying flies, chatting with other fly-fishermen in his Viber group chat, or down by the river casting his rod!</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the interest that he could talk about for hours.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">

Earning money while on the river doing what he loves? amazing!</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>So, he started a fly-fishing brand around his passion in 2020 and grew it to a six-figure business. Now, he makes money creating content while he&#8217;s fishing at the river! Definitely living his dream.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Here are some examples:</h3>



<p>Maybe you&#8230;</p>



<ol class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Geek out over matcha rituals and can&#8217;t get enough of it.</li>



<li>Love travel hacking and finding budget travel hacks.</li>



<li>Are obsessed with meal prepping. </li>



<li>Love all things to do with makeup and beauty, or styling outfits.</li>



<li>Are totally interested in biohacking, astrology, or productivity tools — and your friends come to you because you explain it in a way that makes sense.</li>



<li>Are the go-to person in your group for planning the perfect girls&#8217; trip.</li>



<li>Are the best at organizing small spaces.</li>



<li>Are interested in all things craft beer and have learned how to brew and make it yourself.</li>



<li>Love deep diving into human design and helping friends understand their charts in real life.</li>



<li>Are obsessed with cozy home vibes — from candle making to perfecting your Sunday reset routine.</li>
</ol>



<p>These interests and passions are all things that you could turn into something that helps others and makes you money.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Here are a few real-life examples from our clients:</h3>



<ol class=""wp-block-list"">
<li><strong>A couple living in NYC</strong> with a love for travel and their city, running a travel planning business and creating curated itineraries and trips to NYC for busy professionals</li>



<li><strong>A travel-hacking expert</strong> helping others plan trips and experience the world while spending less</li>



<li><strong>A couple obsessed with quick getaways</strong> and not wasting any time off, they share the best itineraries for 48 hour quick turn adventures</li>



<li><strong>A cat lover</strong> helping other pet parents with their cat&#8217;s health and weight loss</li>



<li><strong>A lover of holistic strategies </strong>and overall wellness helping remote workers escape digital overwhelm and simplify their life</li>
</ol>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Other Examples:</h3>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li><strong>Nick</strong> (of Goats On The Road) turned his passion for fly fishing into an online brand that helps beginners pick the right gear without breaking the bank. That business earned $8,440 on its 12th month after launching!</li>



<li><strong>Joshua Weissman</strong> was a burned out chef who turned his love of cooking (particularly fermentation) into a multi-million dollar YouTube empire.</li>



<li><strong>Sandra James</strong> was laid off from her £50,000/year job in financial services so she decided to turn her love for cats into a business. She founded The Cat Butler, an exclusive cat-sitting service in the UK. She launched it in 2015 and now it earns about £200,000 annually.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Here&#8217;s the thing:</h3>



<p>When it comes to passions and interests, you don’t need to be an “expert&#8221;, you don’t need to have a degree or a huge following.<br><br>You just need to be a few steps ahead of the person you’re helping — and know and care enough about the topic to guide them.</p>



<p>If you love the topic and you&#8217;re SO passionate about it, and you&#8217;re willing to show up and share what you’ve learned, someone out there will be so glad you did. People are looking for someone real, someone who gets it, and someone who makes it feel possible. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Stop Overthinking and Chose One Thing to Start</h2>



<p>You don&#8217;t need to be an influencer, good at tech, or into marketing. Most of our clients aren’t. And actually, most of them started without having <em>any </em>idea of what they could share with the world!</p>

<p><br>taly’s colourful discourse of history, art and natural beauty brings a sense of an open-air art museum to the landscape. Tourists can visit the long-lasting ruins of Rome, lush canals to walk around in Venice, elegant Milanese shopping malls, and the permissive coasts of the Amalfi.</p>



<p>Each city, town or village has its story of the never-ending histories and cultures it experienced for centuries. The tour of Italy is more than just viewing popular attractions. You become entirely immersed, identifying with parts of your being that seem not merely deep but also feel real.</p>

<p>Planning is key. A well-organized itinerary must be written, whether you plan to live in Italy’s cultural richness, try out IT cuisines, look at famous artwork, or undertake adventurous pursuits. </p>







<p><br>Being in touch on your travels is now essential, and <a href=""https://www.getnomad.app"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Nomad eSIM</a> is the perfect solution.

<p>Explore how best to maximize your trip to Italy. Investigate attractions, decide on travel agencies, book accommodations, taste local cuisines, learn more about how you could travel eco-friendly.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">1. Crafting the Perfect Itinerary: Where to Begin</h2>



<p>Italy&#8217;s wide variety of attractions could make planning a trip seem overwhelming.</p>



<p>Knowing what you enjoy and how to pack your itinerary according to your travel habits. Each region offers something unique.</p>



<p>Famous destinations, plus off-the-beaten-path passages to your itinerary.</p>



<p>If you are a newcomer to Italy, you should also put Rome, <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/what-to-do-in-florence/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">Florence</a> and Venice on your list.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""500"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rome.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-146688"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rome.jpg 1024w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rome-720x352.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rome-768x375.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure></div>


<p>Here you can experience the history of Rome. The ancient ruins of the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, are a constant reminder of the past.</p>



<p>Florence is where you can get a taste of the country&#8217;s art history. The Uffizi Galery and the famous statue of Davide by Michelangelo are just the starting points for art lovers.</p>



<p>Venice is probably one of the most stunning cities in the world, with its dizzying array of canals that criss-cross in a romantic maze.</p>



<p>But Italy&#8217;s magic isn&#8217;t reserved just for it&#8217;s history, food and art. Come in the summer and enjoy a beautiful beach holiday along the Amalfi Coast, with dramatic sea views.</p>



<p>Or head to Sicily to get an edgier view of the country&#8217;s Mediterranean charm.</p>



<p>For explorers and nature lovers, Lake Como in Italy&#8217;s far north has serene landscapes, while Milan remains the fashion capital of Italy, of not the world.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. Navigating Italy: Transportation Tips and Passes</h2>



<p>The country&#8217;s transportation structure guarantees that visitors have numerous options to explore Italy.</p>



<p>A lot of visitors who end up passing through the regions of Italy use the awesome train system to get around.</p>



<p>Then you&#8217;re traveling in Italy, the <a href=""https://www.italotreno.com/en"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Italo</a> and <a href=""https://www.trenitalia.com/it.html"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Trenitalia</a> high-speed trains are faster, while regional trains will allow you to enjoy the countryside as it wizzes past the window.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""900"" height=""595"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/trains-in-italy.jpg"" alt=""travelling schengen visa countries by train"" class=""wp-image-67819"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/trains-in-italy.jpg 900w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/trains-in-italy-720x476.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/trains-in-italy-768x508.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/trains-in-italy-640x423.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"" /></figure></div>


<p>To eliminate stressing when determining train ticket costs later, buying an Italy Rail Pass permits unlimited train travel for several days is best.</p>



<p>Travel guides in Italian cities offer a cheap public transport network with buses, trams, and metro systems in all cities.</p>



<p>If if you want to rent a car, you can drive around the country as well. From Tuscany&#8217;s beautiful valleys, to the stunning coastal roads of the Amalfi Coast. Or you can climb the steep hills of the Dolomites for incredible views.</p>



<p>Either way, traveling around in Italian cities by car can be a bit complicated because of the narrow streets and lack of free and accessible parking spots.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. Accommodation Options: Where to Stay in Italy</h2>



<p>It is very easy to choose accommodations in Italy that follow your budget and your taste in personal style.</p>



<p>In the most significant cities such as Rome, Milan and Florence, you will come across the best hotels with wonderful views, exquisite boutique hotels, or inexpensive accommodations for solo travelers.</p>



<p>To experience the place in full immersion, there is nothing like a family-run bed and breakfast, agriturismo, or villa outside the city.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">

<p>Airbnb and rental activities (for a holiday) are rising, especially with families and larger groups.</p>



<p>When travelling during busy times, such as during summer or the holiday season, making early accommodation reservations to get a room is advisable.</p>



<p>Properly plan your location when choosing an accommodation.</p>



<p>Keeping your residence near public transport makes it easier, while choosing a quieter area gives you the pleasure of a peaceful environment.</p>



<p>Always read reviews and check the amenities offered.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">4. Must-Visit Cities and Hidden Gems</h2>



<p>Although Rome, Florence, Venice, and Milan are among Italy&#8217;s best-known cities, the nation is packed with half-hidden gems ready to be discovered.</p>

<p><strong>Summer (June to August)</strong>:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Choose fabrics that make you feel calm and comfortable throughout the day.</li>



<li>A t-shirt, shorts, a sundress and a wide-brimmed sun hat should be in your bag if you get too hot on sunny days.</li>



<li>As you go to Italy, remember to pack some sunglasses and a good sunscreen to be safe from the harsh Italian sun.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Spring and Fall (April-May, September-October)</strong>:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Layers are your best friend.</li>



<li>Pack T-shirts, a cozy sweater, and an easy-to-wear jacket to roll when it gets cold or hot.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Winter (November to March)</strong>:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Bring warm layers when visiting northern cities such as Milan, Venice or the Dolomites if you know you will be there.</li>



<li>Bring a Coat, Scarf, gloves, and a hat.</li>



<li>Snow is possible in some of Italy&#8217;s higher regions in winter.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Religious Sites</strong>:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Depending on where you enter, it is important to dress respectfully; for instance, in the Vatican City, you enter St. Peter&#8217;s Basilica and the Duomo of Florence.</li>



<li>Be conscious of your shoulders and knees being covered up while in places of worship.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. Comfortable Footwear: Exploring with Ease</h3>



<p>Having to spend so much time walking in Italy&#8217;s historic centers, you should take the time and money to invest in good, comfortable footwear.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""800"" height=""600"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/P1140192.jpg"" alt=""what to pack for trekking"" class=""wp-image-2075"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/P1140192.jpg 800w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/P1140192-300x225.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">Nick&#8217;s Merrell walking/hiking shoes</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Prefer shoes with enough traction to navigate the crowded cobblestone streets of Rome, Florence or Venice.</p>



<p>If you will hike along Cinque Terre or the Amalfi Coast, use a secure pair of hiking shoes.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. Tech Essentials for Modern Travelers</h3>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li><strong>Portable Charger</strong>: With your smartphone, you&#8217;ll have navigation, photography and connect at your fingertips. Ensure your device is powered during your trip, and use a portable power bank.</li>



<li><strong><a href=""https://www.getnomad.app/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Nomad eSIM</a></strong>: An easy way of maintaining your device connected without requiring you to shift SIM cards. Consistent internet access throughout Italy allows for map navigation, online ticket buying, and contacting family.</li>



<li><strong>Power Adapter</strong>: Types C, F, and L are used by the plugs in Italy. Check whether your adapter can take a C, F, and L junction, widely used in Italy.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">4. Personal Care and Health Essentials</h3>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li><strong>Toiletries</strong>: Pack travel bottles of shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, and other essential skincare products for your journey.</li>



<li><strong>Prescription Medications</strong>: Pack enough of your medication for your travel and carry a photocopy of your prescription.</li>



<li><strong>First-Aid Kit</strong>: Remember to include adhesive bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and the personal medication you bring.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">5. Hydration and Reusable Items</h3>



<p>Many public fountains with safe drinking water are available in cities like Rome and Florence.</p>



<p>Carrying refillable water bottles is handy for keeping hydrated while reducing plastic waste on your journey.</p>



<p>Using a reusable bag for local markets reduces the impact on the environment.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">8. Sustainable Tourism in Italy: Travel Responsibly</h2>



<p>It has been the natural and cultural treasures of Italians that are worth being preserved, and visitors should help to save them.</p>

<li>Get the sights by choosing any means of public transport or walking around the city.</li>



<li>Support local economies by going for goods made by artisans.</li>



<li>Be aware of plastic waste and use reusable items such as a water bottle and a shopping bag in your travel bag.</li>
</ul>

<p>They exist to protect the environment.</p>



<p>In historic cities, respect local customs.</p>



<p>Avoid crowded spots during peak times to enjoy them without the rush.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">9. Italy with Kids and Seniors: Family-Friendly Tips</h2>



<p>Italy is a perfect family destination with something to offer every family member.</p>



<p>Undoubtedly, children will enjoy visiting Rome Colosseum, Venetian gondola tours and attending Florence&#8217;s interactive art class.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">

<p>Older people can take advantage of Italy&#8217;s easy public transport and walkable cities, and it is easy to walk around to see the country&#8217;s attractions.</p>



<p>The retired enjoy reduced ticket rates and faster entrance to prime attractions like the Vatican Museums.</p>



<p>Specifically, hotels for families have cribs and babysitting services, while Tuscany&#8217;s villas have plenty of room for extended parties.</p>



<p>Make eating out fun by ordering pizza for children and healthy Mediterranean meals for seniors.</p>



<p>Travel insurance should be purchased for the case of any unexpected events, the most important to do it for seniors.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">10. Safety and Health Tips for a Hassle-Free Journey</h2>



<p>Travellers need not worry as Italy is a safe place if they take some simple measures.</p>



<p>When you are in popular spots such as <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/travelling-to-rome-italy-ultimate-guide/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">Rome</a> and Venice, hold your valuables as close as possible, remain aware and monitor events around you.</p>



<p>Make sure you drink a lot of fluids, especially during hotter seasons, by having a refillable water bottle in easy reach at all times.</p>

<p>Great pharmacies and hospitals with proper equipment can be found in major cities in Italy.</p>



<p>Always carry a copy of passports and travel passes – just in case.</p>



<p>It would be wise to buy travel money that covers medical emergencies and last-minute cancellations of trips.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Embrace the Magic of Italy</h2>

<p>This isn&#8217;t an article I wanted to write&#8230; but here it goes.</p>



<p>Blogging as a business model isn&#8217;t just dying—it&#8217;s already dead.</p>



<p>In recent months, we&#8217;ve seen major blogs shut down, course creators abandon ship, and even people who made millions from SEO declare it game over.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s what no one is saying…</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t just about Google updates or AI. The way people consume content has fundamentally changed, and blogs are no longer part of the equation.</p>



<p>So the real question isn&#8217;t just &#8220;Is blogging still worth it?&#8221; It&#8217;s &#8220;If blogging is dead, what actually works now?&#8221;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s get into it.</p>







<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Why Even Top Bloggers Are Walking Away</h2>



<p>For years, blogging was an incredibly lucrative business model. High-ranking blog posts brought in steady organic traffic, which could be monetized through ads, affiliate marketing, and digital products.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio""><div class=""wp-block-embed__wrapper"">
<iframe title=""Should You Start a Blog in 2025?"" width=""1200"" height=""675"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q609tIb6CTs?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" referrerpolicy=""strict-origin-when-cross-origin"" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>But in 2023, that all changed. Some of the biggest names in blogging started pulling out. Even we were offered over half a million dollars for our blog—but we turned it down. And then, things took a turn.</p>



<p>Traffic disappeared. Revenue plummeted. And old SEO strategies stopped working overnight.</p>



<p>So what happened?</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Brutal Truth About Why Blogging Tanked</h2>



<p>This isn&#8217;t just another fluff story like the thousands of other clickbaity articles on the internet right now. I&#8217;m not going to tell you blogging is dead, and then later in this post say… unless you do it the way I teach in my courses.</p>



<p>No. I&#8217;m going to give you my real, honest take on the state of SEO, content sites, affiliate marketing, and blogging as a business model.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re currently a blogger and you&#8217;ve been holding on optimistically dreaming of your traffic coming back, or if you&#8217;re a brand new blogger and you&#8217;ve just put a ton of work into your new site&#8230; or if you&#8217;ve always wanted to start a blog but now I&#8217;m sitting here and shitting all over the entire business model&#8230; don&#8217;t worry.</p>

<p>There IS a silver lining here. It&#8217;s a part of this story that no one is talking about&#8230; a shift that actually opens up the biggest online business opportunity we&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>



<p>And those who adapt now are going to win bigger than ever before.</p>



<p>Make sure you read to the end of this post because I&#8217;m going to talk about exactly what that shift is and how you can leverage it to explode your own online business.</p>



<p>So how did we get here? Why has blogging taken such a drastic downturn in such a short time? It wasn&#8217;t just one thing—it was a perfect storm of changes that hit all at once. If you&#8217;ve been wondering why blogs are shutting down and SEO strategies are failing, here are the biggest culprits behind the collapse of blogging as a business model.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">1. Google Changed the Rules</h3>



<p>Google rolled out AI-generated search results, which means fewer people are clicking over to actual blogs. At the same time, they prioritized forums like Reddit and Quora over independent websites.</p>



<p>If you search for something like &#8220;Best Travel Credit Cards,&#8221; you&#8217;re more likely to see a Reddit thread or TripAdvisor post at the top of search results than a well-researched blog article.</p>



<p>And this wasn&#8217;t an accident—Google struck a $60 million per year deal with Reddit to use their forums to train AI models. In return, Reddit&#8217;s content gets priority in search rankings, effectively pushing smaller blogs out of visibility.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-large is-resized""><img decoding=""async"" width=""825"" height=""1100"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7311-2-825x1100.jpg"" alt=""Nick &amp; Dariece laptops blogging"" class=""wp-image-163610"" style=""width:415px;height:auto"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7311-2-825x1100.jpg 825w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7311-2-540x720.jpg 540w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7311-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7311-2.jpg 900w"" sizes=""(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px"" /></figure></div>


<p>This all started with the Helpful Content Update in 2022, and continued with the Hidden Gems Update in the fall of 2023. Instead of rewarding high-quality blog content, Google handed the search results over to forums.</p>



<p>Remember those traffic graphs of your favorite travel bloggers tanking? Well, Reddit&#8217;s traffic increased by over 650%, hitting 1.3 billion in that same timeframe. This was no mistake.</p>



<p>For small bloggers, this is devastating. Even if you write the best post on the internet, you&#8217;re fighting an uphill battle just to get seen.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. AI Flooded the Internet with Junk Content</h3>



<p>When ChatGPT launched, bloggers didn&#8217;t think, &#8220;How can I use this to make better content?&#8221; They thought, &#8220;How many AI-written posts can I publish per day?&#8221;</p>



<p>As a result, search results became flooded with generic, AI-generated content. Google responded by rolling out updates that penalized AI-heavy websites, but even high-quality blogs got caught in the fire.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1100"" height=""619"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ai-Writing-Content-1100x619.jpg"" alt=""Ai Writing Content"" class=""wp-image-163612"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ai-Writing-Content-1100x619.jpg 1100w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ai-Writing-Content-720x405.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ai-Writing-Content-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ai-Writing-Content.jpg 1280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"" /></figure></div>


<p>And here&#8217;s the problem&#8230; most bloggers didn&#8217;t use AI to improve their content, or to help them research their facts, or make their sites more user-friendly—they used it to spam the web.</p>



<p>Since the release and mainstream adaptation of ChatGPT, research shows that as many as 7.5 million blog posts are being published every single day. The search results have turned into a wasteland of soulless, regurgitated AI content. Google knew this was a problem, so their response? Burn it all down.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that meant even high-quality blogs got caught in the fire.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. Google&#8217;s AI Answers Took Over Search Results</h3>



<p>Google now generates AI answers right in the search results—pulling information directly from blogs without sending any traffic back to them.</p>



<p>If you search &#8220;Best Places to Visit in Thailand,&#8221; Google&#8217;s AI summarizes the best options at the top of the page. Users get the information they need without ever visiting a blog.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1100"" height=""619"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AI-Overviews-Google-Results-1100x619.jpg"" alt=""AI Overviews Google"" class=""wp-image-163614"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AI-Overviews-Google-Results-1100x619.jpg 1100w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AI-Overviews-Google-Results-720x405.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AI-Overviews-Google-Results-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AI-Overviews-Google-Results.jpg 1280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"" /></figure>



<p>For bloggers, this means they&#8217;re not just getting buried in search rankings—they&#8217;re getting erased from the equation entirely.</p>



<p>If UGC and AI spam were the storm, Google&#8217;s AI-generated answers were the final tsunami that wiped out everything left standing. It&#8217;s like playing a game where you do all the work&#8230; and someone else takes the trophy.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the other brutal truth no one is talking about—even if Google wasn&#8217;t killing blogs, consumers already moved on.</p>



<p>Think about it. When was the last time you made a purchase decision—whether it was for a trip, a new phone, or a course—by reading a 3,000-word blog post?</p>



<p>You didn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>Instead, you probably:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Watched a YouTube review</li>



<li>Checked TikTok for quick pros &amp; cons</li>



<li>Looked at Instagram reels for real-world examples</li>



<li>Asked in a Facebook or Reddit group for recommendations</li>



<li>Read Amazon reviews and checked testimonials on social media</li>
</ul>



<p>This is just how people buy now—we want quick, visual, and trusted information from people we actually follow and engage with.</p>



<p>You might think that this is a direct result of people losing trust in blogs because so many are just written with AI, but that&#8217;s not the case. The truth is, this change started happening long before bloggers had tools like ChatGPT and Claude.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Is SEO Totally Dead?</h2>



<p>Not entirely—but for most independent bloggers, it might as well be.</p>



<p>Big brands with massive budgets will still use SEO. Even though ChatGPT recently became one of the top 10 websites in the world, currently at number 7, and is climbing quickly, Google is still the god of online traffic for now. It&#8217;s at the top of that list, so big companies with a lot of money will still fight for those top spots.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1100"" height=""309"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SEO-analytics-on-a-laptop-1100x309.jpg"" alt=""SEO analytics on a laptop. the pros and cons of blogging"" class=""wp-image-96372"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SEO-analytics-on-a-laptop-1100x309.jpg 1100w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SEO-analytics-on-a-laptop-720x203.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SEO-analytics-on-a-laptop-768x216.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SEO-analytics-on-a-laptop.jpg 1440w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"" /></figure>



<p>But the days of new bloggers ranking with great content alone are gone. The fight for search engine visibility is too competitive, and Google&#8217;s constant algorithm changes make it impossible to rely on organic traffic.</p>



<p>So if you&#8217;re still trying to grow your business through SEO blogging in 2025, you&#8217;re not just competing with Google—you&#8217;re competing with how people actually consume content now.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re writing SEO blog posts and trying to rank in Google for keywords&#8230;. Stop it.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re doing some variation of that, like trying to rank for Bing or ChatGPT… Stop it.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re working on the technical SEO for your website and trying to optimize it. Stop it.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a complete waste of time.</p>



<p>There are other things you should be working on if you want to build a sustainable, future-proof business, and we&#8217;ll get to that a bit later.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">What Actually Happened to Our Blogging Businesses (And How We Pivoted)</h2>



<p>We still make passive income from our websites, but only because we&#8217;ve been around for many years. We have 4 of them, and (thankfully) they&#8217;re still bringing in over six-figures a year from ads and affiliates.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve invested in SEO and link building over the years, and built up our audience, which gave us some cushioning as everything collapsed.</p>



<p>But we knew we needed to pivot years ago. More than 7 years ago, we realized that we were putting WAY too many eggs in the blogging basket.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Working-Blogging-Laptop-Desktop-Computer.jpg"" alt=""Upset nick looking at traffic on blog on laptop at table"" class=""wp-image-150095"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Working-Blogging-Laptop-Desktop-Computer.jpg 1024w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Working-Blogging-Laptop-Desktop-Computer-720x492.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Working-Blogging-Laptop-Desktop-Computer-768x525.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>We relied completely on Google SEO, Affiliates, and Ads to pay us our salary. But it didn&#8217;t take long to realize that Ads dropped as much as 50% seasonally or depending on the political situation, and affiliates? Don&#8217;t even get me started&#8230;</p>



<p>I already wrote a post on how Airbnb cancelled their affiliate program without warning, costing us $100,000 per year. And that was just one of MANY times that happened to us.</p>



<p>Basically, we were making incredible money, but we had no control over our traffic sources, or the income coming into our bank accounts.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why we started focusing on building our email list (a traffic source that we OWN) and <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/best-things-to-sell-online/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">selling our own products</a>—something we had control over. This took me down a rabbit hole and years of research into learning how to create an awesome course, how to sell a course, how to create email sales automations and funnels, and basically how to earn money <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/profitable-online-course-ideas/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">selling our own products</a> through emails.</p>



<p>That part of our business was really successful and it got us to where we are now. But now, for the past 2 years, instead of relying on blog traffic and SEO to bring in leads, we&#8217;re doing it <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/how-to-stand-out-on-social-media/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">through social media</a>.</p>



<p>Now before you say what I used to say back then and be like &#8220;I hate social media&#8221;, let me tell you that for one, you&#8217;re probably 40+ like me, and two, that attitude will likely be the single reason you probably won&#8217;t have a <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/reasons-to-start-an-online-business/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">successful online business </a>in 5 years.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">What This Means for the Future of Online Business</h2>



<p>Blogging is no longer a viable business model, but that doesn&#8217;t mean online business is dead. In fact, there has never been a better time to build a profitable business.</p>



<p>The best way I can explain this is through a surfing analogy. No, I&#8217;m not a surfer, but just bear with me for a minute&#8230;</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">

<p>We were riding this massive wave of SEO and Blogging. We made millions of dollars on that wave and at the time, we thought it was the best wave in the sea.</p>



<p>But while we were cruising on that wave&#8230; a bigger, more beautiful, and more sustainable wave was building momentum behind our wave.</p>



<p>That wave was Social Media.</p>



<p>In business, you have to know when to get off the wave. Because if you ride it too long, it&#8217;ll crush you. And in businesses that involve technology, those waves can come extremely quickly.</p>



<p>In the tech landscape, the SEO wave was like a massive tidal wave. It lasted SO long, and we&#8217;re incredibly grateful for that.</p>



<p>But now, the new wave is here, and it&#8217;s been here for a long time, us older generation just didn&#8217;t see it.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Future of Online Business: Social Media, Digital Products, and Email Marketing</h2>



<p>If blogging was the old wave, social media is the new one. And it&#8217;s the biggest opportunity for organic traffic and monetization we&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/software-for-social-media-managers.jpg"" alt=""software for social media managers"" class=""wp-image-78336"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/software-for-social-media-managers.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/software-for-social-media-managers-720x504.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/software-for-social-media-managers-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/software-for-social-media-managers-640x448.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /></figure></div>


<p>This wave is the biggest opportunity we&#8217;ve ever seen in the online world:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>It&#8217;s the biggest opportunity to build a massive audience for free</li>



<li>It&#8217;s the biggest opportunity for organic traffic</li>



<li>And it&#8217;s by far the biggest opportunity to monetize and make millions of dollars from selling digital products</li>
</ul>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">1. Build an Audience with Short-Form Video</h3>



<p>Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts are where people are consuming content now. Instead of writing 3,000-word blog posts, creators are building massive audiences through short-form video.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. Sell Your Own Digital Product</h3>



<p>Unlike blogging, social media lets you monetize fast—if you have the right product. Instead of earning $0.002 per visitor through ads, you can sell a $37 digital product and make real money instantly.</p>



<p>People like Natalie from Boss Babe have made over $100,000 per month selling a simple digital product. And we know of a woman who made over a million dollars in a year from her tiny audience of less than 3,000 people.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1100"" height=""688"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Courses-Page-Featured-Image-Nick-Holding-Laptop-1100x688.jpg"" alt=""Nick holding laptop showing Goats On The Road courses outside"" class=""wp-image-83159"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Courses-Page-Featured-Image-Nick-Holding-Laptop-1100x688.jpg 1100w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Courses-Page-Featured-Image-Nick-Holding-Laptop-720x450.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Courses-Page-Featured-Image-Nick-Holding-Laptop-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Courses-Page-Featured-Image-Nick-Holding-Laptop-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Courses-Page-Featured-Image-Nick-Holding-Laptop-640x400.jpg 640w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Courses-Page-Featured-Image-Nick-Holding-Laptop.jpg 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">A much fatter version of me unveiling my first blogging course <img src=""https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png"" alt=""😂"" class=""wp-smiley"" style=""height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"" /></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This just wasn&#8217;t possible with blogging. There might&#8217;ve been some off chance that you got picked up by a big TV network or something and you went viral overnight, but for 99.9% of bloggers who were just writing blog posts for SEO, it would take months, often years, before they&#8217;d see any income.</p>



<p>Even me. I built a fly fishing website from $0 to $8,400 per month in a single year. But for the first 6 months, it earned next to nothing. And I knew what I was doing!</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. Use Email Marketing to Automate Sales</h3>



<p>Your blog should be a website—not a content hub. It should:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Build authority</li>



<li>Capture emails</li>



<li>Sell your product</li>
</ul>



<p>Email marketing is where the real money happens. By leading social media followers to a freebie, you can build an email list that nurtures leads and automates sales.</p>



<p>Of course, you can&#8217;t just make money on social media by posting funny cat videos. You create highly targeted content that speaks to a specific person, helps them achieve a specific transformation, and that content sends them to your email list where they enter their name and email to get your super valuable freebie.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1100"" height=""619"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Email-Marketing-1100x619.jpg"" alt=""Email Marketing"" class=""wp-image-163615"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Email-Marketing-1100x619.jpg 1100w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Email-Marketing-720x405.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Email-Marketing-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Email-Marketing.jpg 1280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"" /></figure></div>


<p>It&#8217;s from that freebie, and from the magic of email marketing that you&#8217;re able to sell your digital product to them and make money on autopilot.</p>



<p>Look, making $17 on a $500 Airbnb booking was great, and earning 0.002 cents per visitor on our blog was also cool, but there&#8217;s nothing like the feeling of waking up and seeing that someone purchased your $500 course or your $4,000 coaching program. It&#8217;s validation, it&#8217;s exciting to be able to have a <em>real </em>impact and help people, and it&#8217;s the first steps in building a real, loyal community.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Future is Here—And It&#8217;s Not Blogging</h2>



<p>Blogging used to be an incredible business model, but times have changed. Google and AI have made it nearly impossible for new bloggers to succeed the way we did years ago.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean the opportunity is gone. It&#8217;s just moved.</p>



<p>Writing SEO blogs had become monotonous and boring. Ask any successful blogger, we were tired of writing the 10 best things to do in Bangkok and the 15 best budget microwaves.</p>



<p>Do I miss the passive income from blogging? Absolutely, but that same passive income is available with short-form video and great email marketing.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""500"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/17-Passive-Income-Streams-Every-Digital-Nomad-Should-Explore-19.jpg"" alt=""passive income making money online dollars on laptop $100"" class=""wp-image-156170"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/17-Passive-Income-Streams-Every-Digital-Nomad-Should-Explore-19.jpg 1024w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/17-Passive-Income-Streams-Every-Digital-Nomad-Should-Explore-19-720x352.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/17-Passive-Income-Streams-Every-Digital-Nomad-Should-Explore-19-768x375.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure></div>


<p>Blogs take a TON of work. So to do all that work just to have a Google Algorithm update or AI completely wipe you out overnight? That&#8217;s just not worth it.</p>



<p>The future is short-form video. The future is creating a valuable product. The future is having an epic email list that people love being subscribed to. The future is being a real human being, and really connecting with your audience online.</p>



<p>This is the future. And the people who embrace this shift now are going to win big.</p>



<p>If you want to build a business that actually works in 2025, focus on short-form video, digital products, and email marketing. This is how you create a real, future-proof business.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Why Visit Cabo San Lucas?</h2>



<p>Cabo San Lucas is by far one of the <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/12-best-places-to-visit-in-mexico/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">most popular places to visit in Mexico</a> &#8211; and for good reason too. Like <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/things-to-do-in-cancun/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">Cancun</a> and <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/puerto-vallarta-mexico/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">Puerto Vallarta</a>, here we’ll find a diverse range of activities and awesome things to see, as well as many off the beaten path experiences and lesser-known gems to visit nearby too.</p>

<p><strong>Given Cabo is located in the far north of Mexico, the weather here is hot year-round &#8211; which makes it ideal to explore its golden-sand beaches during any month of the year</strong>. This includes the lively Médano Beach where all of the hotels and restaurants are located, as well as to Chileno Beach and Playa del Divorcio to enjoy some crystal-clear snorkelling conditions.</p>



<p>Cabo San Lucas also has many thrilling activities to take part in for a really memorable vacation here. This includes going deep-sea fishing with local charters to<a href=""https://www.boatsbaja.com/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer""> </a>reel<a href=""https://www.boatsbaja.com/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer""> </a>in a big catch (check out <a href=""https://www.boatsbaja.com/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">BoatsBaja.com</a>), spotting Blue Whales and Humpback Whales, eating tasty Mexican cuisine and even flying on a zip line through the desert canyons. </p>



<p>Later in this guide we’ll take a look at the very best things you can see and do when in Cabo San Lucas.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Planning Your Trip To Cabo San Lucas</h2>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">How To Get To Cabo San Lucas</h3>



<p>Given its close proximity to <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/united-states-travel/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">the USA</a>, most visitors usually connect with a flight from here (unless flying directly of course). <strong>The nearest airport to Cabo San Lucas is Los Cabos which is roughly 30 minutes away and is the best way of getting into the city</strong>. Here we can find regular flights here from cities like Miami, Dallas, Chicago and Seattle for between $70-130 for a one-way ticket.</p>



<p>We recommend booking your flights on <a href=""https://www.expedia.com/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Expedia.com</a> or through <a href=""https://www.google.com/travel/flights"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Google Flights</a>.</p>

<p>Although Cabo San Lucas is disconnected from the major mainland of Mexico, it’s still possible to arrive here without flying. Those in nearby <a href=""https://www.rome2rio.com/s/La-Paz-Mexico/Cabo-San-Lucas"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">La Paz can take a simple 2 hour bus here</a>, whilst those further north in Tijuana can enjoy a memorable coastal road trip south to reach Cabo.</p>



<p>Another option is taking the ferry from the region of Sinaloa on the mainland to La Paz, followed by the two hour bus. They depart on a weekly schedule from <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/things-to-do-in-mazatlan/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">Mazatlán</a> and Topolobampo, and take roughly 9 hours to arrive to La Paz.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">How Many Days Do You Need In Cabo San Lucas?</h3>



<p>Once you know how to get to Cabo San Lucas, another major topic is working out how much time you’ll need here to see all of the main highlights and have the best experience possible.</p>



<p><strong>Usually I suggest between 4-6 days in Cabo San Lucas. This amount of time is perfect for enjoying the various golden-sand beaches and sea activities, and also for taking a day trip to explore other parts of Baja California Sur (such as La Paz or Todos Santos).</strong></p>



<p>If you’re heading here for a more specific reason like learning how to surf, or if you want to rent a yacht or go fishing, then you&#8217;ll probably want to extend your trip to over a week or so so you can take full advantage.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Best Time To Visit Cabo San Lucas</h3>



<p>Before you start booking your flights, it&#8217;s always good to check different weather seasons can bring different advantages and disadvantages.</p>



<p><strong>The dry season is by far the most popular time to visit, which runs from November until April. </strong></p>



<p><strong>At this time of year, expect dry and warm sunny days most of the time, which is perfect for hitting up a beach or anything outdoors</strong>. The only drawback is that it can get very busy with crowds around this time, especially obviously closer to the Christmas holidays.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/medano-beach-in-cabo-san-lucas.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-108322"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/medano-beach-in-cabo-san-lucas.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/medano-beach-in-cabo-san-lucas-720x432.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/medano-beach-in-cabo-san-lucas-768x461.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /></figure></div>


<p>The wet season begins in May goes through to October, and is also a great alternative time to visit Cabo San Lucas. Even though there&#8217;s more rain, and the days are balmy, there are usually enough sunny days sprinkled in for a good trip.</p>



<p>Just know that stormy weather (and potential hurricanes) are most likely to happen between the months of September and October.</p>



<p>Lastly, another important consideration is the various fauna that can be spotted around this Pacific city. Whales can be spotted off the coast during their annual migration north between January and March, whilst you can also swim with Whales Sharks from November until April. </p>



<p>If you’re looking to go fishing in Cabo, then the best time is between the months of July and October during the rainy season.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Cabo San Lucas Packing List</h3>



<p>As Cabo is warm year-round, this makes it quite easy to pack for this coastal city. It’s similar if you are planning a longer trip around Mexico too, given most parts are also usually hot!</p>



<p>Below we’ll list a great starting packing list for your trip to Cabo San Lucas, as well as all of the essentials that you’ll want to bring:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>T-shirts and vests.</li>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Best Things To See And Do In Cabo San Lucas</h2>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Visit The Arch Of Cabo San Lucas</h3>



<p>Jutting-out of the Pacific Ocean, the Arch of Cabo is by far one of the most impressive landmarks you can see around the city. <strong>A naturally-created rock formation, you can spot it from Médano Beach and is also beautiful to watch when the sun is setting beyond it</strong>. You can also head out on a boat tour to get even more impressive pictures, and also explore the hidden beach behind it.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Hike Up To The Cerro De La Zeta Mirador</h3>



<p>Translating locally as a viewpoint, the best <em>mirador</em> in Cabo San Lucas is located on top of&nbsp; a mountain just west of the city centre. It takes just under an hour to complete the hike up the Cerro De La Zeta, <strong>where you can enjoy a quieter walk with less crowds around and some picturesque arid vegetation along the way</strong>. At the top there are impressive views over both Cabo as well as the surrounding Pacific Ocean.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Enjoy Cabo’s Famous Nightlife</h3>



<p>What really makes Cabo San Lucas come alive is its legendary nightlife scene after the sun goes down. <strong>Regardless if you’re after a hectic night out, or want more of a chilled-out evening by the beach &#8211; there’s plenty of options for everyone here</strong>. There are lots of bars near the Marina and along Avenida Lázaro Cárdenas such as Jungle Bar and Monkey Business Bar, whilst nightclubs such as La Vaquita and El Squid Roe promise an eventful scene.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Head On A Local Taco Tour</h3>



<p>All over Cabo San Lucas you can find many epic dishes that mix both Mexican classics as well as some of the more popular cuisine that hails from the Baja California Sur region. <strong>Trying them by yourself can sometimes be daunting, which is why I recommend joining Juan More Taco for an awesome street food experience</strong>. Not only will you try all kinds of exotic local dishes, your expert guide will also be on-hand for any questions you may have!</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Go Deep-Sea Fishing</h3>



<p>Given its location along the Pacific, Cabo San Lucas is a perfect spot to go deep-sea fishing where you can find popular catches such as the Blue Marlin, Wahoo and Yellowfin Tuna species. <strong>The overall best time to go fishing is between July and October, although other months are still good for different big catches</strong>. </p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fishing-trip-in-cabo-san-lucas.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-108346"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fishing-trip-in-cabo-san-lucas.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fishing-trip-in-cabo-san-lucas-720x432.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fishing-trip-in-cabo-san-lucas-768x461.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /></figure></div>


<p>You&#8217;ll find lots of <a href=""https://maps.app.goo.gl/hkAcAkRFYF2p4bZz8"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">local companies around the harbour like Boats Baja</a>, who organize both fishing charters and private yachts.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Is Cabo San Lucas Safe To Visit?</h2>



<p>Like with most cities around Mexico, Cabo San Lucas has both its safe and unsafe areas &#8211; with the Harbour and Médano Beach neighbourhoods being the best for a stay. </p>



<p><strong>Of course you’ll still want to take the usual precautions such as leaving valuables back in your apartment when heading out, and also not wandering off into unknown neighbourhoods alone at night</strong>.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""666"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/tequila-tasting-in-cabo-san-lucas.jpg"" alt=""tequila tasting in cabo san lucas"" class=""wp-image-75986"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/tequila-tasting-in-cabo-san-lucas.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/tequila-tasting-in-cabo-san-lucas-720x480.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/tequila-tasting-in-cabo-san-lucas-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/tequila-tasting-in-cabo-san-lucas-640x426.jpg 640w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/tequila-tasting-in-cabo-san-lucas-753x500.jpg 753w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /></figure></div>


<p>Outside of the tourist areas and hotel resorts, it can get a little more sketchy in certain areas. Usually these neighbourhoods aren’t recommended for tourists to venture into alone &#8211; and to be honest usually don’t have any redeemable sites or attractions (and aren’t really places that tourists would want to head to). If for any reason you need to go, I suggest using Ubers to and from, and also to try to visit during the daytime (unless going with a trusted friend or tour guide).</p>



<p>The last piece of advice in terms of how you can stay safe is to follow local guidance. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re renting a car, or renting a boat, check with the operator to find out about any potential safety concerns you might have. <a href=""https://www.boatsbaja.com/cabo-fishing-guide/is-it-safe-to-travel-to-cabo-san-lucas/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Boats Baja</a> has an entire post on keeping safe in Cabo. </p>



<p>This includes any tips you can pick-up from the receptionist in your hotel, as well as from any tour guide you travel with. This way you can learn some valuable advice such as why you should avoid drinking tap water, as well as if any particular areas are not worth heading to right now.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Our Tip Tips For Visiting Cabo San Lucas</h2>



<p>Below we’ll now share some of our own personal top tips for having the best experience possible when in Cabo San Lucas.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Avoid Drinking Unsafe Water</h3>



<p>Having already mentioned this above, you&#8217;ll really want to double-down on the water situation here. Unfortunately the public water systems aren’t treated at all, and as a result many unsuspecting tourists get nasty stomach bugs and can fall ill. <strong>Always drink from sealed bottles of water, and try to avoid getting ice in drinks when heading to restaurants</strong>.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Head To Cabo During The Shoulder Seasons</h3>



<p>Sandwiched between the dry and wet seasons, <strong>these periods often offer us the best of both worlds when coming to Cabo. These include the months of November, May and June</strong>. </p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/scuba-diving-Cabo-San-Lucas.jpg"" alt=""scuba diving Cabo San Lucas"" class=""wp-image-78882"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/scuba-diving-Cabo-San-Lucas.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/scuba-diving-Cabo-San-Lucas-720x504.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/scuba-diving-Cabo-San-Lucas-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/scuba-diving-Cabo-San-Lucas-640x448.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /></figure></div>


<p>Not only can you enjoy warm temperatures and great weather with less crowds around, you can also get involved with local cultural celebrations such as the Day of the Dead (which is an important Mexican event that takes place every early November).</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Keep An Open Mind During Your Trip</h3>



<p>There’s a lot more going for Cabo than just its beaches and endless nightlife options, and as a result I recommend trying to keep an open mind when here. Whilst visiting off the beaten path destinations is a good start, <strong>I also suggest visiting other places in the nearby region such as Todos Santos for its awesome surfing and La Paz for its spectacular beaches.</strong></p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Overview Of Cabo San Lucas</h2>



<p>And that’s all for this guide on how to plan your own trip to Cabo San Lucas, as well as the surrounding regions of Baja California Sur.</p>



<p><strong>This Mexican paradise is already a hot destination to visit in the country, with its scene and activities rivalling those of Cancún and Puerto Vallarta</strong>. As we’ve now seen, Cabo is also home to a massive range of activities, so your only issue will be working out how to fit them all into just one trip here!</p>



<p>As always, planning your trip in advance will help make it more smooth and enjoyable. </p>

What Makes A Good Website: 10 Must-Have Features,https://www.goatsontheroad.com/what-makes-a-good-website/,"Tue, 18 Feb 2025 10:45:13 +0000",Krystianna Pietrzak,Blogging For Beginners,"
<p>When you&#8217;re getting your business up and running online, it can be challenging to figure out what makes a good website. Now, more than ever, it’s essential to have a website that showcases everything your business is about, even if you have a brick-and-mortar store.</p>



<p>Since I began <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/how-to-start-freelancing-with-no-experience/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">freelancing</a>, I’ve created numerous websites, but the most important one is the one that showcases my services. Without it, I would not have received as many clients as I have.</p>



<p>I owe a lot of my business success to implementing the features of a good website listed in this article. This post covers everything you’ll want to know about elevating your website to the next level.</p>







<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">What Makes a Good Website?</h2>



<p>These are the main things to consider when creating a website.</p>



<p><em>Don&#8217;t forget, having a website is an essential part of your brand&#8217;s ecosystem. This gives you klout and proves you&#8217;re a real business.</em> <em>If you feel overwhelmed by the whole idea, we can build your website for you, simply <a href=""mailto:dariecegoatsontheroad@gmail.com"">contact us</a>. Or, when you start a website <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/start-a-blog/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">using this link</a>, you receive our free website in a weekend course which shows you step by step how to get your website up and running.</em></p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">1. SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)</h3>



<p>How do you make a good website? Well, you make sure that it has SEO implemented, or else it’s never going to get any traffic from any search engine, especially Google. In order to have your content seen, you&#8217;ll need SEO.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image wp-image-78571 size-full"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/seo-search-engine-optimization-and-content-marketing-concept.jpg"" alt=""seo search engine optimization and content marketing concept"" class=""wp-image-78571"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/seo-search-engine-optimization-and-content-marketing-concept.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/seo-search-engine-optimization-and-content-marketing-concept-720x504.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/seo-search-engine-optimization-and-content-marketing-concept-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/seo-search-engine-optimization-and-content-marketing-concept-640x448.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">A great website pays attention to good SEO.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>SEO can take time to build up, so make sure that you start implementing it when you start your website for good measure. If you don’t know a whole lot about it, I suggest investing in an SEO course or using free resources that you can find online.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. Design</h3>



<p>Without a strong design, you aren’t going to have an appealing website. Design is what sets your website apart from others so that it doesn’t look so cookie-cutter.</p>



<p>Truth be told, the design does not have to be as in-depth as you might initially think. It can be as simple as using a free template and changing out the colours to make sure that it doesn’t match other websites that use the same template.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. Calls to Action</h3>



<p>To know what makes a good website, you have to learn what a CTA, or call to action, is. Essentially, this is any time on your site that you prompt your visitor to do something.</p>



<p>For example, “download now” is a simple CTA commonly used when talking about freebies on a website.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image size-full wp-image-78575"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a-powerful-call-to-action.jpg"" alt=""a powerful call to action"" class=""wp-image-78575"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a-powerful-call-to-action.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a-powerful-call-to-action-720x504.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a-powerful-call-to-action-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a-powerful-call-to-action-640x448.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">Make sure to create a powerful call-to-action phrase&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The best way to make these recognizable is to have them be designed the same way every time there’s a CTA. So, maybe <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">every CTA</a> has a green background so that your visitor knows where they’re prompted to do something.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">4. User Experience</h3>



<p>At its core, your website was created to help, educate, or inspire a visitor. So, you want to make sure that users can quickly get around your website without much hassle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think about what would make the most sense as someone visiting your site. What do you want them to see first? Would they be more likely to look for your social media links at the top of your site or in the footer?&nbsp;</p>



<p>User experience will be different for every industry.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">5. Links</h3>



<p>Links are essential when it comes to having a strong website. Not only is it good for SEO, but it makes your user experience a lot better too.</p>



<p>When I say links, I don’t only mean links to other websites but also other pages or posts within your own site. Interlinking your content is key for navigation, and having readers see more of your content.</p>



<p>If you mention a freebie or a downloadable that you offer, be sure to link to it.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">6. Easy to Read</h3>



<p>When you write your website copy, you want to think about how easy it is to read. Keep in mind that legibility and readability are two different things; legibility is discussed later in the &#8216;what makes a good website design&#8217; section of this article.</p>

<p>Readability refers to how easy your writing is to read by someone else. You don’t want to oversimplify your copy, but you do want to make sure that anyone who visits your website will be able to read and understand, what you have to say.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">7. Simplicity</h3>



<p>When it comes to a website, simplicity goes a long way. Never go overboard. Don’t have a million pages with a ton of colours that don’t go together at all.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, you want a minimal website that gets the point across without being too flashy (learn more about design below).</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">8. Security</h3>



<p>Without security, people aren’t going to feel safe doing anything on your website. This includes making purchases or even just visiting your most recent blog post.</p>



<p>It may sound simple, but make sure that you have an <a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-ssl"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">up to date SSL certificate</a>. When someone visits your site, they should see a locked padlock in the top left corner by the URL if they are on Google Chrome.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">9. Consistently Fresh Content</h3>



<p>Consistently creating fresh content is what makes a great website.</p>



<p>You want to make sure that you are always updating your site and adding new posts when necessary. This doesn’t mean you have to do it every day, but you should be posting something new at least once a week.</p>



<p>By consistently posting, you help your SEO rankings and show visitors that your site is still active and frequently used.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">10. Mobile Optimisation</h3>



<p>What else do you need to make a good website? You need to make sure that your website is responsive on all screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image wp-image-78578 size-full"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/responsive-design-website-on-a-variety-of-devices.jpg"" alt=""responsive design website on a variety of devices"" class=""wp-image-78578"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/responsive-design-website-on-a-variety-of-devices.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/responsive-design-website-on-a-variety-of-devices-720x504.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/responsive-design-website-on-a-variety-of-devices-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/responsive-design-website-on-a-variety-of-devices-640x448.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">Make sure to produce a good responsive website design for all devices.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>If your site is not responsive, you miss out on reaching a lot of potential website visitors. If someone is on their phone and wants to see your website, they should not run into any problems — otherwise, they&#8217;ll click away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, most website builders will make your site responsive for you automatically.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">What Makes a Good Homepage?</h2>



<p>The homepage is an important part of your whole website — without an appealing one, people are just going to click away from your site.</p>



<p>Here are a few of the features you&#8217;ll want to make sure you have on your homepage.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">1. Clear Logo</h3>



<p>This probably goes without saying, but one of the features of a good website is to have a clear logo that isn’t overdone. This should be situated in your header so that people always know exactly what website they are on.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image wp-image-78580 size-full"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Designer-team-sketching-a-logo-in-digital-design-studio-on-computer.jpg"" alt=""Designer team sketching a logo in digital design studio on computer"" class=""wp-image-78580"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Designer-team-sketching-a-logo-in-digital-design-studio-on-computer.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Designer-team-sketching-a-logo-in-digital-design-studio-on-computer-720x504.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Designer-team-sketching-a-logo-in-digital-design-studio-on-computer-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Designer-team-sketching-a-logo-in-digital-design-studio-on-computer-640x448.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">A great logo design will help your website standout.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Your website’s logo should not be super fancy. In fact, the simpler your logo, the better. If too much is done to it, then it will be hard to read.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. Lots of CTAs</h3>



<p>Lots of CTAs are what makes a good homepage. Take the <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">homepage of Goats on the Road</a>, for example; there are at <i>least </i>seven different CTAs, prompting visitors to “subscribe,” “learn more,” and “download for free.”</p>



<p>Without CTAs, your visitors aren’t going to know what you have to offer them. The best place to showcase them is right on your homepage so that visitors don’t have to go too far into your website to find all the good stuff!</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. Recent Blog Posts or Resources</h3>



<p>You should always showcase your most recent blog posts, if you have any, right on the home page. Yes, this doubles for service providers and other small <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/profitable-online-course-ideas/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">online business </a>owners too.</p>



<p>You could do this in a few ways, but the best way (as far as web design goes) is to showcase the featured image with the post title and post date. You could opt to include a short excerpt if you wish as well.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">4. About Section</h3>



<p>Even though your website should be mainly centered around how you can help other people, you do want to include a short section introducing your visitors to the face behind the business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On your homepage, make sure to include an excerpt from your about page along with a photo (or a video if you want to get snazzy) and link to your actual about page with a “read more” CTA button.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">5. Social Media Links</h3>



<p>One of the most underrated features of what makes a good homepage is having social media follow links either in your header, sidebar, or footer.</p>



<p>You mainly want your visitors to subscribe to your website, but having them follow you on other platforms can help your brand reach and exposure.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image size-full wp-image-78581"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/social-media-links.jpg"" alt=""social media links"" class=""wp-image-78581"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/social-media-links.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/social-media-links-720x504.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/social-media-links-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/social-media-links-640x448.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">A good homepage has all the social media links.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Ensure that you make these easily accessible with a simple “follow us elsewhere” line of copy or something similar.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">6. Simple Tagline on a Website Banner</h3>



<p>Your homepage should quickly introduce all visitors to what you do and what your site can help them with.</p>



<p>That’s why you don’t want to underestimate the power of writing a strong line of copy to go above the fold of your website (that is, the part of your website that can be seen without scrolling).</p>



<p>A great example of this, again, is the <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">homepage for Goats on the Road</a>! By simply visiting this website and not even scrolling, you already know that the Goats are here to help you turn travel into a lifestyle.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">7. Showcase Freebies or Offers</h3>



<p>One of the easiest and best ways to grow your email list is to have free offers or resources that visitors can sign up for and download instantly. Whether it’s a checklist, ebook, template, or something else, you want to showcase it on your homepage.</p>



<p>Dedicate one of the sections on your homepage to only showcasing your freebies, or at least featuring one of your most popular free offers that you know people will want to sign up for.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">8. Subscription Links</h3>



<p>Separate from social media links, you want to make it easy for someone to simply sign up for your email newsletters if they want to. This helps grow your list and lets your visitors know that they can easily keep up with you if they wish to.</p>



<p>A common way to do this is to add a subscribe link in the footer, but you can also dedicate a whole section on your homepage to it, too, if you want.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">9. Benefits Section</h3>



<p>What are the benefits of someone visiting your website? One of the best features of a good website is a section showcasing exactly how you can help someone, separate from what you wrote above the fold in your website banner.</p>



<p>Will you help grow their follower count on Instagram if they sign up for your social media services? Maybe you’ll help them prepare for life on the road as a digital nomad. Perhaps you can help them start a business and coach them along the way.</p>



<p>Whatever it is, let people know, so they don’t have to scour your website to find out what it’s even about.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">10. Social Proof</h3>



<p>Finally, a great feature to have on your homepage, depending on your services or what your website is about, is to showcase social proof. This works a bit better with service-based business websites or websites that sell products.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image size-full wp-image-78583"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/social-proof.jpg"" alt=""social proof"" class=""wp-image-78583"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/social-proof.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/social-proof-720x504.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/social-proof-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/social-proof-640x448.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">social proof will help grow your website.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>An example of this is if you have a course, for instance, on how to travel the world on a budget. Showcase a few testimonials from students of the course on your website, so people visiting know that you are legit.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">What Makes a Good Website Design?</h2>



<p>If you are wondering what makes a good website, then you&#8217;re in the right place. Below, learn more about specific design elements that can help elevate your website above your competition.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">1. Use of White Space</h3>



<p>Many people think they have to cover every little possible space on the page when designing a website. Well, I’m here to tell you that you want to do the opposite.</p>



<p>Think about it; the more you overdesign a page, the more distracting it’s going to be. White space is your friend, which is one of the first things any graphic designer is taught while in school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Use the white space to your advantage to guide your visitor throughout your website.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. Consistent Typography</h3>



<p>Typography is one of the most challenging design aspects to learn, but you want to keep it as simple and consistent as possible. For instance, if you always use Times New Roman in all caps for your headers, make sure it’s like that on all pages.</p>



<p>You also want to put together fonts that work well. Often, this isn’t two serif fonts because that can get distracting. Instead, pair together two simple sans serif fonts or a serif and a sans serif for a touch of elegance.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. Imagery</h3>



<p>When thinking about what makes a good website, you probably initially think of imagery. If you want your website to be visually intriguing, you need to include images throughout your site.</p>



<p>While this may seem picky, the best way to use images is to make sure that they are all on-brand and edited in the same way. By doing this, you ensure that the pictures aren’t too distracting to the visitor but instead enhance their experience on your website.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">4. Strong Branding</h3>



<p>One of the best features of a good website is branding, which is something many people just starting out overlook.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At a minimum, you need to make sure to have a logo, colour palette, and type suite, or else your website isn’t going to be cohesive.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image size-full wp-image-78585"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/digital-marketing-website.jpg"" alt=""digital marketing website"" class=""wp-image-78585"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/digital-marketing-website.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/digital-marketing-website-720x504.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/digital-marketing-website-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/digital-marketing-website-640x448.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">A well-branded website stands out the best.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>If you aren’t a designer and can’t afford to hire one, then you can use a free tool like <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/canva/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">Canva</a> to start yourself off and then later invest when it’s the right time. For colours, make sure you choose at least three, along with a few neutrals to use as background colours.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">5. Simple Navigation</h3>



<p>Simple navigation is truly what makes a good website design. Without it, nobody is going to be able to move around your website.</p>



<p>I’m sure you’ve visited a website or two and then immediately clicked out because you couldn’t figure out where the menu was or how to get to another page. I’ve been there too. That’s why navigation is so important.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">6. Use of Hierarchy</h3>



<p>Hierarchy is what makes a great website stand out from an average one. In simple terms, hierarchy refers to seeing what’s most important first, then what’s next most important second, and so on.</p>



<p>You want to make their experience on your website easy and straightforward so that they will want to return.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">7. Readability</h3>



<p>Have you ever visited a website only for it to be a completely yellow background with lime green text or something similar? A terrible design like that will immediately turn someone away from your website, and they’ll look for resources like yours elsewhere.</p>



<p>So, what do you need to make a good website legible? Think about the text. Without proper text, font and colour, nobody will be able to read what you’re saying, and your design will not be very pretty or aesthetically pleasing.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">8. Focus on the Customer or Visitor</h3>



<p>Many people who build a website make the mistake of focusing mainly on themselves, especially on the home page. Unfortunately, people aren’t visiting your website to hear your life story (most likely); instead, they’re visiting to learn from you.</p>



<p>If you want to have a strong website, make sure you take the time to focus all of your copywriting on your visitor. Call out their problems and struggles and how your website is here to help them. It will make them feel like you know them even though you don’t.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">9. Design Consistency (i.e. grids)</h3>



<p>Design consistency is one of the simplest features of a good website that is often overlooked. When designing a website, you want to think of it as a fluid layout with a grid, and everything you add to the page should fit on the grid.</p>



<p>For instance, if the majority of your design fits within 1200px of your site, then the rest of your design should too. Otherwise, it will stand out too much and will look like a mistake, distracting your visitors from the rest of your page.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">10. Animations</h3>



<p>This is a bit of a bonus, but adding fun animations like hover or scroll transitions can set your website apart from the others out there in the same niche as you.</p>



<p>Whether you’re designing your website on Squarespace or <a href=""https://www.bluehost.com/track/gotr/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">WordPress</a>, this is pretty simple to learn how to do.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image wp-image-78586 size-full"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/animation-icon-for-a-website.jpg"" alt=""animation icon for a website"" class=""wp-image-78586"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/animation-icon-for-a-website.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/animation-icon-for-a-website-720x504.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/animation-icon-for-a-website-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/animation-icon-for-a-website-640x448.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">Consider placing an animation icon to look your website better.</figcaption></figure></div>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">How To Make a Good Website</h2>



<p>Follow the steps below to get started on creating your website. Remember to include all the other tips mentioned in the other sections of this article.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Step #1. Buy a website domain</h3>



<p>You can’t even start creating a website until you have a domain (ie: www.goatsontheroad.com). There are many different sites out there, but usually, wherever you purchase your hosting, you can also buy a domain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you buy your domain, be sure to create an email account as well (ie: yourname@goatsontheroad.com).</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Step #2. Buy hosting and choose your website platform</h3>



<p>Next, it’s time to purchase your hosting. There are tons of great hosts out there, but <a href=""http://bluehost.sjv.io/WDeXDM"" rel=""nofollow external noopener noreferrer"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"">Bluehost</a> is a great option that’s affordable and reputable.</p>



<p>Then, you’ll want to choose where to make your website. We recommend <a href=""https://wordpress.com/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">WordPress</a>.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re really unsure of what you&#8217;re doing and would like to pay for it, you can hire someone do to the <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/how-to-make-money-coding/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">coding and web development</a> for you. Or, <a href=""mailto:dariecegoatsontheroad@gmail.com"">contact us</a> and we&#8217;ll create a professionally designed website for you. </p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Step #3. Design, design, design</h3>



<p>The most creative part of making a website is designing, and that’s what you get to do next! No matter what platform you chose, there will most likely be free templates that you can utilise when making your website to save you a lot of time.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image size-full wp-image-78588"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a-web-designer-is-working-on-her-good-website.jpg"" alt=""a web designer is working on her good website"" class=""wp-image-78588"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a-web-designer-is-working-on-her-good-website.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a-web-designer-is-working-on-her-good-website-720x504.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a-web-designer-is-working-on-her-good-website-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a-web-designer-is-working-on-her-good-website-640x448.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">Keep on designing and improving your website to look better.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>When using a template, remember to change the colours and add your branding, or else your site will look like every other site out there that used the same template. You could also consider purchasing a paid template so you’ll be a bit more original.</p>



<p>If you want to get real fancy, you could also use a drag and drop builder like <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/elementor/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">Elementor, </a>which can be used with any WordPress template, including free ones. With Elementor, you can easily customize any page on your website.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Step #4. Create your pages.</h3>



<p>Last but not least, take the time to create the pages for your website. Usually, this includes having a homepage, about page, contact page, and services page.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pages that are essential for your business website might be different from ones required for another, so make sure you thoroughly research competitors in your field to see what sections they have. Then, make them your own without copying.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Step #5. Write all of your web pages</h3>



<p>While the design is important, words are what stick with people, and you want to make sure that you have copywriting that resonates with your visitor.</p>



<p>Take the time to sit and write out the copy for all of your pages. You could also hire a professional writer if you’d rather not deal with it on your own.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Now you know what makes a good website! While each industry might be different, the features listed in this article are the basic necessities for a website that sells your brand.</p>



<p>Making a good website takes time, so don’t rush it and carefully plan out what you’re going to do each step of the way. My most recent website build took me one whole month, but that’s what it takes to have a strong one.</p>



<p>I wish you the best of luck with creating the perfect website for your business.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=digital%20marketing"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Digital marketing</a> is one of the most lucrative online course niches. Businesses of all sizes are constantly looking for ways to <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/marketing-strategies-to-boost-your-online-presence/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">strengthen their online presence</a>, creating a huge demand for skilled professionals who know how to get results.</p>



<p>If you have expertise in <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/how-to-build-seo-backlinks/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">areas like SEO</a>, social media strategy, or email marketing, you could create a course that helps others to master these valuable skills. It&#8217;s a fairly competitive niche, but the key to success is offering clear, actionable guidance.</p>



<p>Be sure to include practical modules on keyword research, campaign analytics, and advanced advertising techniques for <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/best-platforms-to-sell-online-courses/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">platforms</a> like Google Ads. Focus on practical advice that your students can apply immediately, and give them tools to measure outcomes and monitor their improvement.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>



<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning are shaping the future, making them some of the most trending online course ideas for 2025. These technologies are all over the news right now, and they’re driving innovation in industries from healthcare to finance.</p>



<p>If you have expertise in AI and/or machine learning, you can create a course that equips students with the skills to thrive in this growing field. Focus on foundational topics such as algorithms, data analysis, and popular Python libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p>



<p>To set your course apart, include hands-on projects where students can apply what they’ve learned in real-world scenarios. Practical learning opportunities not only make your course more engaging but also help students build a portfolio they can showcase to potential employers.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. Coaching Courses</h2>

<p>Coaching is one of the most rewarding online course niches. From health and wellness to career coaching, countless people are actively seeking guidance to improve their lives. It’s a field with huge potential for impact and profitability.</p>



<p>Coaching courses often resonate deeply with audiences because they offer tangible, life-changing benefits. Your course could combine practical advice, actionable tools, and support systems that empower learners to achieve their personal or professional objectives. </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">4. Personal Finance and Investing</h2>



<p>Personal finance is one of the online course topics that sells because it <a href=""https://virtualggc.com/blog/why-a-personal-finance-course-is-a-wise-investment/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">addresses a universal need</a> that many people find difficult: managing money effectively. Courses that empower people to take control of their finances can be profitable and genuinely impactful.</p>



<p>The demand for financial literacy courses is high among people from all walks of life. Your course could cover topics such as building a budget, understanding credit, how mortgages and other forms of debt work, and the principles of investing in the stock market or cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Be careful though – in many places, financial services are strictly regulated. The rules depend on what country you&#8217;re in, but in many places – including the U.S. and the UK – it&#8217;s illegal to give certain types of financial advice if you don&#8217;t hold the necessary licenses and certifications.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">5. Coding and Software Development</h2>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">

<p>Technology powers the modern world, making <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/how-to-make-money-coding/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">coding</a> and software development some of the most successful online course topics today. There&#8217;s a huge demand for skilled programmers to <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/what-makes-a-good-website/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">create websites</a>, applications, and other automated solutions.</p>



<p>If you’re proficient in programming languages like Python and JavaScript, or have experience in app development, why not design a course that helps beginners gain confidence in these topics? You’ll appeal to a wide audience eager to learn and upskill in this ever-evolving area.</p>



<p>Focus on step-by-step tutorials, real-world projects, and actionable skills that students can immediately put into practice. To help your course <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/ways-to-stand-out-online-in-a-crowded-market/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">stand out</a>, I recommend structuring it around practical applications, such as building a simple website or automating everyday tasks.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">6. Graphic Design and Digital Art</h2>



<p>Graphic design and digital art are <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/best-graphic-design-software/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">highly sought-after skills</a>, which makes them popular online course subjects. From marketing materials to branding and social media content, visually appealing designs are essential in a range of different fields.</p>



<p>You don’t need to be a professional graphic designer or artist to teach in this niche. As long as you have solid skills and practical knowledge, there’s a market for your expertise and you can make good money sharing your experience.</p>



<p>You could create a course (or multiple courses) on many different topics, from mastering tools including Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or Canva, to teaching fundamental design principles and portfolio-building strategies.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">7. Language Learning Courses</h2>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1100"" height=""825"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Alex-Tiffany-remote-working-freelancer-1100x825.jpg"" alt=""Remote worker Alex working from beautiful location.

<p>Language learning is one of the most versatile online course ideas for beginners. If you&#8217;re reading this, I assume you can speak at least one language, and – luckily for you – English is one of the <a href=""https://www.visualcapitalist.com/most-popular-languages-people-want-to-learn/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">most popular languages</a> people want to learn worldwide.</p>



<p>Other widely spoken languages like Spanish, Mandarin, and French are always in high demand too, but you could create <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/requirements-teach-online/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">language courses</a> on whichever language(s) you speak. It&#8217;s a broad and potentially lucrative niche, with a practically limitless audience.</p>



<p>To create a successful language course, focus on practical and engaging content. Interactive lessons, quizzes, and real-world dialogues can make your course more effective and enjoyable. Courses that emphasize conversational skills and cultural insights tend to resonate most with learners.</p>



<p>The riches are (often) in the niches, so consider tailoring your course to meet the individual needs of specific groups of people. Businesspeople wanting to learn basic Mandarin for work. Students wanting to learn Spanish for a year abroad. French for backpacking. You get the picture.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">8. E-commerce and Online Business</h2>



<p>If you know a thing or two about e-commerce and <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/mistakes-to-avoid-when-starting-an-online-business-2/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">online business</a>, you could have a massive pool of aspiring entrepreneurs and business owners as potential students. With the right guidance, your course could help people all over the world create and <a href=""https://learn.goatsontheroad.com/webinar/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">grow successful online businesses</a>.</p>



<p>Your course could cover whatever you&#8217;re knowledgeable about and have experience with. Think along the lines of essential skills such as product sourcing, <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/start-a-blog/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">website creation</a>, tips for selling through online marketplaces and platforms like Etsy and Amazon, as well as digital marketing strategies.</p>



<p>Whatever topics you decide to cover, focus on providing actionable steps that empower learners to take their ideas from concept to execution. By offering practical tools and expert advice, your course can inspire and equip your students to turn their entrepreneurial dreams into reality.</p>



<p>As a great example, Dariece and Nick, the founders of Goats On The Road, offer a course &amp; community to help online creators identify, conceptualize, and launch a life-changing remote business. These guys are super experienced when it comes to online businesses, so it&#8217;s a natural fit for them. <em><a href=""https://learn.goatsontheroad.com/webinar/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Click here</a> to learn more about that program.</em></p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">9. Photography and Videography</h2>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1100"" height=""825"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Alex-Tiffany-remote-working-mountain-location-laptop-remote-work-1100x825.jpg"" alt=""remote worker digital nomad destination, beautiful mountain backdrop views and laptop on desk"" class=""wp-image-162038"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Alex-Tiffany-remote-working-mountain-location-laptop-remote-work-1100x825.jpg 1100w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Alex-Tiffany-remote-working-mountain-location-laptop-remote-work-720x540.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Alex-Tiffany-remote-working-mountain-location-laptop-remote-work-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Alex-Tiffany-remote-working-mountain-location-laptop-remote-work-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Alex-Tiffany-remote-working-mountain-location-laptop-remote-work-2048x1536.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"" /></figure></div>


<p>Given the popularity of<a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/how-to-stand-out-on-social-media/"" data-wpel-link=""internal""> social media and content creation</a>, more people than ever are looking to improve their skills behind the camera or in the editing room. If you have these skills, photography and videography could be some of the best online course ideas for you to create.</p>



<p>This niche offers endless opportunities, from teaching landscape photography to advanced video editing techniques. Your course could include modules on essential topics like camera settings, lighting, and using post-production software such as Lightroom or Premiere Pro.</p>



<p>If there are particular types of photos or videos you enjoy taking, editing, and creating, I recommend focusing on these to help differentiate your course from the others. Enjoy shooting portraits? Landscape photography? What about adventure travel vlogging? Lean into what makes you stand out and the areas you love most.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">10. Remote Work Productivity and Management</h2>



<p>As <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-13/remote-work-productivity.htm"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">remote work becomes more common</a>, productivity and <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/remote-work/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">remote</a> management skills are becoming increasingly important. This makes it a high-demand online course idea, especially in a post-pandemic world where <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/signs-youre-a-digital-nomad/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">remote work</a> is the norm for many people.</p>



<p>I know plenty of folks who wish they were better at being productive, efficient, and effective when working remotely. You could help equip them with time management techniques, creating ergonomic workspaces, or how to <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/work-life-balance-digital-nomad/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">improve work-life balance</a> when working from home.</p>



<p>To help you define your ideal customer, think about creating tailored courses catering to certain types of remote workers, like freelancers, <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/cheapest-digital-nomad-destinations/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">digital nomads</a>, or remote teams looking for better work-life balance or increased efficiency.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">In Conclusion</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re good at things that other people want to be good at, chances are you can create profitable online courses around those topics. By tapping into popular demand and tailoring them to your audience, you can build a successful course that stands out and provides real value.</p>



<p>From digital marketing and AI to fitness, finance, and language learning, the possibilities for creating profitable online courses are endless.

The 5 Best Multi-Day Hikes To Do From Cusco,https://www.goatsontheroad.com/the-5-best-multi-day-hikes-to-do-from-cusco/,"Sun, 02 Feb 2025 07:51:17 +0000",George Alvarez,Peru,"
<p>One of the most diverse cities you can visit in all of Peru, Cusco is known both for its incredible architecture and nearby Sacred Valley region.</p>



<p>However it’s the surrounding Andean landscapes that really bring this city and region to life, where we can find multi-colored mountains, deep blue glacial lagoons, snow-capped peaks and untamed wildlife in all corners. <strong>As a result there are many unforgettable hiking circuits to head on from Cusco, which all offer something slightly different</strong>.</p>



<p>In this article we’ll explore 5 of the very best multi-day hikes that you can do from <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/things-to-do-in-cusco/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">Cusco</a>, and why each one is worth the visit. We’ll also cover everything else you need to know for a trip, including the best time to hike, preparation and how to book a tour.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Why Head On A Multi-Day Hike From Cusco?</h2>



<p>One of the very best countries to go trekking within South America, Peru has many incredible hiking circuits which include those found in Huaraz as well as those within the Amazon Jungle. However the multi-day circuits that can be taken from Cusco are something special in their own right.</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/things-to-do-in-Cusco-Peru.jpg"" alt=""things to do in Cusco, Peru"" class=""wp-image-79565"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/things-to-do-in-Cusco-Peru.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/things-to-do-in-Cusco-Peru-720x504.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/things-to-do-in-Cusco-Peru-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/things-to-do-in-Cusco-Peru-640x448.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /></figure></div>


<p>Just over 500 years ago this region was once the beating heart of the legendary Inca civilization, who were both formidable and way before their time. They were perhaps best known for their advancements in stonemasonry and architecture, which allowed them to create many incredible structures which we can still see today (such as the perfectly-fitted giant stones of Sacsayhuamán Ruins).</p>



<p>During a multi-day hike from Cusco we can see even more of these spectacular creations, and especially on the <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/inca-trail-machu-picchu-hike/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">Inca Trail</a> which includes the strongholds of Wiñay Wayna and Sayaqmarca. <strong>On other treks we can also interact with different remote Andean communities, who still live and practice the ancient ways of their ancestors today</strong>.</p>



<p>Of course the scenery of these regions are special in their own right, which includes multi-coloured Rainbow Mountains, towering snow-capped peaks and high Amazon Jungle. Given the variety of biomes here, this means we can see a variety of exotic animals along treks such as Vicuñas, Spectacled Bears, Viscachas as well as the emblematic orange Cock-of-the-rock (which is the national bird of Peru).</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">How To Get To Cusco</h2>



<p>Despite Cusco’s remote location deep within the Peruvian Andes, getting here is quite simple given how it has now become one of the most popular places to visit within this iconic South American nation. <strong>Regardless of which you choose, you’ll first need to arrive into <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/things-to-do-in-lima/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">the capital of Lima</a>, which is the main gateway into Peru</strong>.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1100"" height=""825"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cusco-square.jpg"" alt=""cusco square"" class=""wp-image-71457"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cusco-square.jpg 1100w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cusco-square-720x540.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cusco-square-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cusco-square-640x480.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"" /></figure>



<p>Flying from Lima to Cusco is the most popular option, which is a one hour flight over the scenic Andes Mountains. Airlines such as LATAM and Sky Airlines operate dozens of flights daily, with a one-way costing roughly $35-50 (without baggage). This is the best option for those who are either short on time in Peru and want to arrive into Cusco without delay, or for those who want a more comfortable travel option.</p>



<p>Our next method of getting from Lima to Cusco is by bus, which despite being the cheaper option (around $20-30), will take a sobering 20-22 hours to arrive from the capital. Within the district of La Victoria in Lima we can find numerous bus operators which all vary in comfort and extras, with the most popular being Palomino and Paredes Estrella. Of course the long ride puts many off, however it is a solid option for those who want to cut travel costs, those who have a longer time in Peru or for those who simply want a new adventure.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">The 5 Best Multi-Day Hikes To Do From Cusco</h2>



<p>Alright let&#8217;s go! Here are the best multi-day hikes you can do from Cusco. Of course everyone knows number one, but there are other must-see hikes as well.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Four Day Inca Trail To Machu Picchu Hike</h3>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1100"" height=""800"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-3.jpg"" alt=""The Four Day Inca Trail To Machu Picchu Hike"" class=""wp-image-163521"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-3.jpg 1100w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-3-720x524.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-3-768x559.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"" /></figure></div>


<p>Out of all the different Cusco treks you can head on, the <a href=""https://abexpeditions.com/inca-trail-4-days/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Four Day Inca Trail To Machu Picchu</a> is the best all-rounder for nature, history and culture. Here we will hike along the same stone steps that the ancient Inca once took to get to Machu Picchu, where we’ll also visit lost ruins such as those of Sayaqmarca, Wiñay Wayna and Intipata.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>As well as camping in some extraordinary locations within the Andes, we’ll also get to enjoy many diverse landscapes along the hike</strong>. This includes epic mountain views such as those from Dead Woman’s Pass, trekking through remote cloud forest as well as exploring the high Amazon Jungle. There’s also a chance of spotting animals like Vicuñas, Spectacled Bears and the elusive Cock-of-the-rock Bird.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Five Day Salkantay Trek</h3>



<p>If you love epic mountain scenery, then the Salkantay trek is by far your best bet. Set much higher up into the remote Andes than the Inca Trail, here we will see lots of snowy passes, icy lagoons as well as giant glaciers along the hike.</p>



<p>Here we will also get to visit many famous sites, <strong>such as the deep-blue lagoon of Humantay, Machu Picchu as well as getting up and close with Apu Salkantay &#8211; one of the tallest mountains in all of the Cusco region</strong>. It’s important to mention that the altitudes can be quite difficult along this trek, so you’ll want to follow our key high altitude hiking tips which we’ve listed later in this article.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Four Day Ausangate Trek To Rainbow Mountain&nbsp;</h3>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1100"" height=""800"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-1.jpg"" alt=""The Four Day Ausangate Trek To Rainbow Mountain "" class=""wp-image-163522"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-1.jpg 1100w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-1-720x524.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-1-768x559.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"" /></figure></div>


<p>Peaking at a towering 6384m above sea-level, the Ausangate Mountain is the highest of all in the Cusco region (and the fourth highest in Peru). <strong>Along the hike this means we will experience incredible high mountain passes such as those of Surini and Arapa, as well as many multicoloured lakes dotted throughout the region</strong>.</p>



<p>During the <a href=""https://abexpeditions.com/ausangate-trek-4-days/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Four Day Ausangate Trek To Rainbow Mountain</a> we’ll also get to experience authentic local culture, as we meet indigenous cultures in the mountains and also have a homestay within the Upis settlement on the first day. The other special thing about this particular trek is how the surrounding mountains slowly become more red as we continue hiking &#8211; until we eventually culminate the hike at the unforgettable Rainbow Mountain.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Five Day Lares Trek And Short Inca Trail To Machu Picchu</h3>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1100"" height=""800"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-2.jpg"" alt=""The Five Day Lares Trek And Short Inca Trail To Machu Picchu"" class=""wp-image-163523"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-2.jpg 1100w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-2-720x524.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-2-768x559.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"" /></figure></div>


<p>One of the biggest pulls of hiking outdoors around the Cusco region is getting out into untamed nature, and also experiencing a variety of beautiful scenery. This is where the Lares Trek to Machu Picchu is arguably one of the best well-stocked, <strong>where we’ll see crashing waterfalls, turquoise lagoons, giant glaciers as well as indigenous Quechua villages along the hike</strong>.</p>



<p>During the last two days we’ll then join on to the Short Inca Trail, which takes a slightly different route from the classic 4 day hike. Here we’ll pass through the ancient Chachabamba Ruins, and also others such as Wiñay Wayna before finally enjoying the historic sanctuary of Machu Picchu at the very end of the hike.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Three Day Huchuy Qosqo Trek To Machu Picchu</h3>



<p>If getting off the beaten path and experiencing lesser-explored routes is a must for you, then the three day Huchuy Qosqo trek to Machu Picchu is a great contender. Located within the remote sacred valleys above Lamay, <strong>Huchuy Qosqo is another Inca stronghold that is also connected up by a lesser-known part of the original Inca Trail</strong>. It’s believed that this site once served as a retreat and ceremonial site for the Inca Elite.</p>



<p>During the multi-day hiking experience we will also get to visit the ancient ruins of Patabamba and Moray, and also get to visit the legendary Maras Salt Mines &#8211; which are one of the most popular sites to see within the entire Sacred Valley region of Peru. On the last day we will also enjoy a guided tour around Machu Picchu, and learn why this site was so formidable and remained completely undetected during the Spanish Conquest.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Best Time To Hiking Around Cusco</h2>



<p><strong>The dry season is the overall <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/peru-travel-guide/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">best time to go</a> hiking due to frequent clear blue skies, which begins in May and lasts until October</strong>. This is where we usually have clear blue skies and virtually no rainfall most days, which is perfect for views along the different routes. It does also fall within the winter season, and as a result temperatures can get much colder during these months (so you’ll need to bring extra layers, gloves and a hat).</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/things-to-do-in-cusco-peru.jpg"" alt=""things to do in cusco peru"" class=""wp-image-80503"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/things-to-do-in-cusco-peru.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/things-to-do-in-cusco-peru-720x504.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/things-to-do-in-cusco-peru-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/things-to-do-in-cusco-peru-640x448.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /></figure></div>


<p>The wet season isn’t as popular, but still offers many of its own benefits for hikers here. Lasting from November until April, these months see much more rainfall than the dry season, which can sometimes cause flooding on roads and more difficult hiking conditions (with certain routes closing such as the Inca Trail during the month of February). The benefits however include more comfortable temperatures, less crowds as well as a better chance of seeing wildlife and greener pastures.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">How To Prepare For A Multi-Day Cusco Trek</h2>



<p>A big part of your hiking experience and success here in Cusco comes down to solid preparation, which often begins long before you come to Peru. Below we’ll explore the main factors which you’ll want to plan properly for in advance.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Pre-Booking Your Hiking Tour</h3>



<p>One of the best things you can do is to book your hike early, which guarantees both your spot and preferred camping locations. <strong>Hikes like the classic four day Inca Trail trek can run out of spaces quickly, so we highly recommend booking at least 6 months in advance</strong> <strong>to guarantee your spot</strong> (only 500 permits are available each day). It’s important to note that treks aren’t as popular in the wet season so you can sometimes get away with a late booking &#8211; however it can be risky leaving it all up to a last minute chance.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Preventing Altitude Sickness</h3>



<p>The biggest issue for travellers heading to Cusco is altitude sickness &#8211; given the city is located up at 3399m above sea-level (whilst much of the rest of Peru is situated lower down). </p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1100"" height=""800"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-4.jpg"" alt=""Preventing Altitude Sickness Hiking Cusco"" class=""wp-image-163524"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-4.jpg 1100w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-4-720x524.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hiking-Around-Cusco-4-768x559.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"" /></figure></div>


<p>It’s common for symptoms such as headaches and sickness can occur, and especially so when heading on these higher-altitude treks which often surpass 4000m in altitude. <strong>We suggest spending at least two days in Cusco prior to your trek for your body to start acclimating, and also to drink Coca Leaf Tea which helps prevent symptoms</strong>. You can also buy Soroche Pills in Cusco which are the most effective method of preventing altitude sickness.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Packing Properly For Your Trek</h3>



<p>Packing properly can really make or break your hiking trip, so you’ll want to make sure have everything you need before arriving into Cusco.</p>



<p><strong>As a starting point you’re going to need both light layers, as the sun can be intense during the day. During the evenings the temperatures will dip quickly, so you’ll also need to bring some thick layers too</strong>. </p>

<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""900"" height=""675"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hiking-around-cusco.jpg"" alt=""hiking from cusco to Sacsayhuaman peru"" class=""wp-image-61111"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hiking-around-cusco.jpg 900w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hiking-around-cusco-720x540.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hiking-around-cusco-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hiking-around-cusco-640x480.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">Hiking up to the incredible Sacsayhuaman ruins just outside of Cusco</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>We highly suggest bringing walking poles if you are inexperienced or have had injuries from hiking before. Other important things to bring include a hat, thick socks and warm gloves (especially when heading on the higher altitude treks such as those around Ausangate and Salkantay).</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Important Tips Before Heading On A Multi-Day Cusco Trek</h2>



<p><strong>Tip #1: Book Your Hiking Tour With A Local Operator </strong>&#8211; Cusco is a very popular place to go hiking within Peru, and this means we can find all kinds of different agencies who offer all kinds of different tours. I highly recommend booking with local hiking company AB Expeditions, who are highly reputable and operate all of the treks mentioned in this article. Not only will you have high quality gear and local expertise, you’ll also be helping them to improve wages and standards for local communities within the Cusco region.</p>

<p><strong>Tip #2: Head To Cusco During The Shoulder Seasons</strong> &#8211; As we mentioned earlier in this article, the dry season remains the most popular time to hike around Cusco for its great weather. However you can do one better and plan your hike during the shoulder months (April, May, September and October), where you will still have perfect weather for those memorable mountain photos whilst having less tourist crowds around.</p>



<p><strong>Tip #3: Embark On Gentle Day Hikes Around Cusco Before Your Multi-Day Hike</strong> &#8211; If you’re still worried about getting altitude sickness, then another way of getting prepared for your trek is to head on gentle day trips from Cusco as a way of getting acclimated both quicker and smoother. This includes hiking around Pisac Ruins, Ollantaytambo and up to the Cristo Blanco Statue in Cusco &#8211; all of which are located at not-so-demanding altitudes &#8211; whilst still helping your body to acclimate.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Overview Of The Best Multi-Day Hikes To Do From Cusco</h2>



<p>And that’s all for this guide on the best multi-day hikes that you can do from Cusco.</p>



<p><strong>Known for its stunning mountains, ancient history and high-altitude lagoons, Cusco and the surrounding Sacred Valley region are home to many impressive multi-day treks</strong>. With proper planning you can easily enjoy one (or many) hikes during your trip, which may end up being your best highlight during your trip to Peru.</p>



<p>As always, be sure to take the altitude seriously and to go slowly, and also to make sure you pack everything you need before heading on your trek. Depending on the season you will be visiting, you’ll also want to book your hike at least 3-6 months in advance to guarantee your spot on your dream Cusco multi-day trek.</p>

<p>After 3 years of full-time traveling, I&#8217;m often asked &#8220;Where is the best place you&#8217;ve visited?&#8221; It&#8217;s a tough question but <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Montenegro/@54.0897911,-15.0090205,5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x134c3217242c1fcb:0x384c9d866effd346!8m2!3d42.708678!4d19.37439!16zL20vMDU2dnY!5m2!1e1!1e4?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEwOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Montenegro </a>always ranks highly in my answer.

<p>I spent a month house sitting in <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/digital-nomad-guide-to-living-in-ho-chi-minh-city/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">Ho Chi Minh City</a>, and it soon became one of my favorite, affordable digital nomad destinations. This city oozes a startling contrast where traditional Vietnamese culture meets business and ultra-modern amenities.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s one of the most affordable cities I&#8217;ve ever visited, where meals at local eateries cost just <a href=""https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Ho-Chi-Minh-City?displayCurrency=USD"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">$1–$3</a> and are usually hearty and delicious. Transport is straightforward, with <a href=""https://www.grab.com/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Grab</a> rides <a href=""https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Ho-Chi-Minh-City?displayCurrency=USD"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">costing a few bucks </a>and the option of cheap buses to take you anywhere you need to go.</p>

<p>I only spent a few weeks working remotely from <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/living-in-mexico-city/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">Mexico City</a> but I found it to be an electric and motivating place to be based as a digital nomad.

<p>Being a huge metropolis, certain areas can feel pretty posh, but the hefty bill you&#8217;re expecting never comes.

<p>Becoming a house sitter in Singapore is easier than you might think. Start by creating a profile on a reputable house-sitting platform, highlighting your experience, reliability, and of course your love for, and experiences with pets. <br><br>A <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/pet-sitter-house-sitter-profile/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">well-written profile</a> with references from past sits or personal character references can make all the difference. Keep things updated and utilize functions such as setting alerts for house sits in Singapore or highlighting your available dates.</p>



<p>There are a host of great options out there and many tools to help you<a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/how-to-become-a-house-sitter/"" data-wpel-link=""internal""> become a house sitter</a> in Singapore. Here are five of the best house sitting platforms to kick-start your journey:</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">1.  Trusted Housesitters </h3>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1100"" height=""972"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tucson-House-sit-1100x972.jpg"" alt=""house sitting in the USA"" class=""wp-image-147650"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tucson-House-sit-1100x972.jpg 1100w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tucson-House-sit-720x636.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tucson-House-sit-768x679.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tucson-House-sit-1536x1358.jpg 1536w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tucson-House-sit.jpg 1731w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">An earlier house sitting and pet sitting job</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><a href=""http://trustedhousesitters.pxf.io/P02yYR"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Trusted Housesitters </a>sets the gold standard for <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/best-house-sitting-websites/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">house sitting websites </a>and is my go-to when it comes to seeking new accommodation opportunities. I use it more than any other travel site &#8211; including all my back-to-back sits in Singapore. I&#8217;ll rave about it to anyone who will listen.<br><br>It has an extensive global network of homeowners and sitters, making it ideal for those seeking house sits in popular cities like Singapore. At a glance today, over 6000 listings are accepting applications globally!<br><br>The platform operates on a membership basis, where both homeowners and sitters pay a modest annual fee, which ensures commitment and trust from all involved. <em>Goats On The Road&nbsp;readers get a special <strong>25% discount</strong> by <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/house-sitting-subscribe/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">clicking this link</a>.</em> </p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. HouseCarers</h3>



<p><a href=""https://www.housecarers.com/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">HouseCarers </a>is a pioneer in the house-sitting world, <a href=""https://www.housecarers.com/about-us.cfm"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">operating since 2000.</a> It has a simple interface but a broad reach, offering opportunities in regions that don&#8217;t always appear on larger platforms. <br><br>For anyone wondering how to become a house sitter in Singapore online, HouseCarers offers a great service and provides a smaller but diverse range of listings. I always recommend having a secondary source for house sitting and this is a good one.</p>



<p>What sets HouseCarers apart is its focus on accessibility and affordability. The platform offers a free membership option, allowing new sitters to test the waters before committing to the premium tier. The annual fee of $50 is well worth it.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. Nomador</h3>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1000"" height=""664"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/housesitting-grenada-coffee.jpg"" alt=""Goats On The Road, house sitting in the Caribbean "" class=""wp-image-76853"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/housesitting-grenada-coffee.jpg 1000w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/housesitting-grenada-coffee-720x478.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/housesitting-grenada-coffee-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/housesitting-grenada-coffee-640x425.jpg 640w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/housesitting-grenada-coffee-753x500.jpg 753w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">One of our many amazing house sits&#8230; right on the beach!</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><a href=""https://www.nomador.com/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Nomador </a>is popular in Europe but has been gaining traction in Asia, including Singapore. It’s a fantastic choice for sitters who value cultural exchange, as the platform emphasizes building trust and relationships between sitters and homeowners. </p>



<p>Nomador offers a &#8220;Stopovers&#8221; feature, which is a unique house sitting aspect that I like a lot. It allows travelers to connect with locals for short stays and is a useful tool if you’re transitioning between house sits.</p>



<p>While the number of listings in Singapore may be more limited compared to Trusted Housesitters, Nomador attracts a community of open-minded homeowners who often prefer sitters with an interest in local culture. </p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">4. MindMyHouse</h3>



<p><a href=""https://www.mindmyhouse.com/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">MindMyHouse</a> is a budget-friendly platform that&#8217;s ideal for sitters contemplating how to get started as a house sitter in Singapore. Its annual membership fee is among the most affordable around at just $29/year!</p>



<p>Though the platform doesn’t have the same volume of listings as larger sites, there&#8217;s still a good variety of options. The platform’s emphasis on clear communication between homeowners and sitters makes it easy to find and apply for assignments.</p>



<p>For those seeking to learn how to become a house sitter in Singapore without any experience, this is a great place to start. The customer service is top drawer and will give confidence to those just testing the waters.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">5. Facebook Groups</h3>



<p>If you’re looking to become a freelance house sitter in Singapore without spending on membership fees, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Facebook </a>groups can be a great resource. Groups including <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/housesittingasia"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">House Sitters Asia</a> or <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/1340164400243809"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Singapore Pet Sitters</a> feature listings preferring informal arrangements.</p>



<p>These groups are free to join and provide access to house sitting opportunities without any middleman. However, unlike other platforms, Facebook groups have limited information on the listings and don’t offer background checks or reviews.</p>



<p>While these groups are an excellent way to start house sitting in Singapore without any experience, they require more diligence. Take time to build trust with homeowners &#8211; a little effort goes a long way.</p>

<p>I looked after three very different homes and some adorable pets during my time house sitting in Singapore. My first sit was in a rejuvenated apartment block within walking distance of <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chinatown,+Singapore/@1.2805071,103.8400246,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x31da1972a27568e3:0xbbc2a66a543ebb05!8m2!3d1.2814942!4d103.8448202!16zL20vMDRiMnps!5m2!1e4!1e1?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEwOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Chinatown. </a>The house rabbit called Papook was no issue at all.</p>



<p>The second sit was just a short bus ride away in the quiet suburb of <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Queenstown,+Singapore/@1.2868989,103.742578,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x31da1a5234b05815:0x500f7acaedaa4b0!8m2!3d1.3012507!4d103.7981323!16zL20vMDRmeTF6!5m2!1e4!1e1?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEwOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Queenstown.</a> The luxury complex felt like a resort with its private pool, gym, and tennis courts. The two pups, Reuben and Mowgli were both easygoing and loved their food and daily stroll.</p>



<p>The third house sit took me to one of the busiest areas called <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bugis/@1.2868983,103.742578,13z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x31da19b073353ebb:0x9cb819dd3ab95d82!8m2!3d1.3001701!4d103.8561248!16zL20vMDZ4eWNx!5m2!1e4!1e1?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEwOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Bugis.</a> The home was wonderful and it was amazing to be based right in the heart of the city. I cared for a dog called Ramen, she was more complex than the others but I still enjoyed my time with her.</p>



<p>I was able to secure back-to-back house sits in Singapore, meaning I left one and was straight onto the next. It&#8217;s not always possible or easy to do so, but when it works out, it&#8217;s my favorite way to travel.

I always felt comfortable, day and night.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to navigate Singapore and feel secure in your surroundings. CCTV cameras operate throughout the city and I even saw a police robot rolling down a street keeping an eye on things! <br><br>However, like anywhere in the world, you should always take basic precautions, such as keeping valuables secure and being aware of your surroundings, particularly when traveling late at night or in busy areas.</p>

<p>Like any city, there are always positives and negatives, and Singapore is no different. Here are the main pros and cons I experienced as a house sitter in Singapore: </p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Pros of Being a House Sitter in Singapore</h3>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Free accommodation in one of the <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2023/11/30/ranked-the-worlds-10-most-expensive-cities-to-live-according-to-a-new-report/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">world’s most expensive cities.</a></li>



<li>Unique cultural immersion through the variety of local neighborhoods.</li>



<li>The joy of caring for pets and a homey environment while in a new country far from home.</li>



<li>Access to luxury accommodation and amenities way out of the average traveler&#8217;s budget for Singapore.</li>



<li>A flexible way to explore Singapore at your own pace, house sitting provides a secure base to operate from.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s an excellent addition to a digital nomad lifestyle. Learn more from this <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/digital-nomad-guide-to-living-in-singapore/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">Digital Nomad Guide to Living in Singapore.</a></li>



<li>The chance to live in one of the world&#8217;s most luxurious cities.</li>



<li>Endless recreational activities, from incredible hiking to a fantastic nightlife scene.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Cons of Being a House Sitter in Singapore </h3>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Responsibilities with homes and pets that can limit your free time and flexibility.</li>



<li>Managing expectations with homeowners can vary considerably from sit to sit.</li>



<li>There&#8217;s high competition for popular sits, and Singapore is a popular area for house sitters and digital nomads.</li>



<li>The cost of living beyond accommodation. Dining out and drinking can be <a href=""https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Singapore?displayCurrency=USD"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">very expensive in Singapore.</a></li>



<li>Singapore&#8217;s<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore#Climate"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer""> tropical rainforest climate</a> means high average temperatures and spells of intense rain year-round.</li>



<li>Singapore is known for its strict laws, from chewing gum bans to hefty fines for jaywalking.</li>

<p>It was always a dream of mine to experience being a digital nomad in New Zealand, and I recently made that dream a reality. As someone from the <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/uk-travel-guide/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">UK</a>, New Zealand is about as far as you can travel before you begin coming home again.</p>






<p>It&#8217;s an expansive and beautiful country and the ideal retreat for remote workers seeking a slower pace tinged with plenty of adventure, culture, and fun. I&#8217;ve never visited anywhere quite like New Zealand and I can&#8217;t wait to tell you all about it.</p>

<p>New Zealand is an island in the Pacific, packed with jaw-dropping landscapes and lots of opportunities for adventure. From epic forests and breathtaking mountains to quirky little towns and big cities, it’s popular with nature lovers and thrill-seekers alike. <br><br>With just over <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">5 million</a> calling it home, you’ll feel welcome wherever you go.

<p>I spent exactly a month as a New Zealand <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/signs-youre-a-digital-nomad/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">digital nomad. </a>This time was split between a 2-week <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/tips-for-landing-a-house-sitting-job/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">house sit</a> in Auckland, a week exploring further afield in the North Island, and a week exploring the South Island.<br><br>Moving so frequently within a month meant I delved into all of my remote working skills and regularly found new places to set up my <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/best-laptops-for-remote-work/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">laptop.</a> Thankfully, I found that even some of the most remote New Zealand towns were well-suited for digital nomads.</p>



<p>Later on, I&#8217;ll discuss a couple of the best coworking spaces in New Zealand and some of the best cafes I found that made great spots for remote working. Although I was over ten thousand miles from home, I always felt well-connected to my work, family, and friends.</p>

I always felt completely safe exploring; whether in the rural countryside, remote towns, or even the bigger cities.</p>



<p>Unlike its Australian neighbor, New Zealand has very few natural predators. You won’t find dangerous snakes or deadly spiders here, just plenty of sheep and birds. I traveled to NZ straight from <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Australia/@-18.7929509,87.2259656,3z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x2b2bfd076787c5df:0x538267a1955b1352!8m2!3d-25.274398!4d133.775136!16zL20vMGNoZ2h5!5m2!1e4!1e1?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Australia</a> so it was nice to relax after 3 months of being on guard!</p>



<p>While New Zealand is generally safe, it’s worth noting the country is <a href=""https://teara.govt.nz/en/map/4416/new-zealand-regions-at-greatest-risk-of-ground-shaking"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">prone to earthquakes</a> due to its location on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Pacific Ring of Fire.</a> Earthquake preparedness is part of daily life and many buildings are designed to withstand tremors.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to travel around many of the country&#8217;s biggest towns and cities. Here are the best places to consider living as a digital nomad in New Zealand:</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">1. Auckland</h3>



<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Auckland,+New+Zealand/@-36.8593557,174.3764684,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x6d0d47fb5a9ce6fb:0x500ef6143a29917!8m2!3d-36.8508827!4d174.7644881!16zL20vMDEydHM!5m2!1e4!1e1?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Auckland</a>, a city built around 2 large harbors is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">home to the bulk of the country&#8217;s population.</a> Subsequently, it has the most familiar big city vibe of anywhere I visited in New Zealand.</p>



<p>The city skyline, specifically the iconic <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sky+Tower/@-36.8484611,174.7597086,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6d0d47f06d4bdc25:0x2d1b5c380ad9387!8m2!3d-36.848448!4d174.762191!16zL20vMDFuNXM2!5m2!1e4!1e1?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Sky Tower,</a> typifies the economic prowess of the city and gives it a true metropolitan feel.

<p>All of my time in Auckland was spent <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/best-house-sitting-websites/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">house sitting</a> in the beautiful and popular suburb of <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Devonport,+Auckland+0624,+New+Zealand/@-36.8225553,174.7883461,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x6d0d37c13bb4dd67:0x500ef6143a2bf70!8m2!3d-36.8246787!4d174.7985219!16zL20vMDFqdzdz!5m2!1e4!1e1?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Devonport.</a> It&#8217;s just a short hop across the water by the ferry or accessible by the Harbour Bridge. Tourists flock here and it was a stunning place to stay.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a truly central spot, <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Auckland+Central,+Auckland+1010,+New+Zealand/@-36.8225553,174.7883461,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6d0d47fb48a99ab9:0x500ef6143a2b3e0!8m2!3d-36.8508852!4d174.7645088!16s%2Fm%2F02w11cg!5m2!1e4!1e1?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Auckland’s CBD</a> is a fantastic choice.

<p>For a more laid-back vibe, <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ponsonby,+Auckland,+New+Zealand/@-36.8507611,174.7288607,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x6d0d479b1af2a6dd:0x500ef6143a2f910!8m2!3d-36.8484732!4d174.7438305!16zL20vMDRoeDBi!5m2!1e4!1e1?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Ponsonby</a> is an area worth considering.

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">How to Find Accommodation in New Zealand</h2>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img decoding=""async"" width=""900"" height=""601"" src=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/new-zealand-pic.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-29308"" srcset=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/new-zealand-pic.jpg 900w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/new-zealand-pic-720x481.jpg 720w, https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/new-zealand-pic-768x513.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"" /></figure></div>


<p>If you plan on being a digital nomad in New Zealand, keep your accommodation options open. Here are the 4 options I used throughout my time in New Zealand:</p>



<p>1. <a href=""https://www.booking.com/?aid=353338&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Booking.com</a>: A handy tool for booking everything from hostels to luxury apartments. <a href=""https://www.booking.com/?aid=353338&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Booking.com</a> often allows for no pre-payment, free cancelation, and price matching, making it a traveler&#8217;s budgeting dream.</p>



<p>2. <a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Airbnb</a>: Whether you&#8217;re planning a city center stay or something more remote in the New Zealand countryside, <a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/"" data-wpel-link=""exclude"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Airbnb</a> has lots of choices on both islands. Always play with your dates to see if you can hit certain discount markers.</p>



<p>3.<strong> </strong><a href=""http://trustedhousesitters.pxf.io/P02yYR"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Trusted Housesitters</a>: Save on all your accommodation costs by securing a house sit. The biggest house sitting site on the market regularly has listings across New Zealand. I secured a 2-week stay in Auckland and <a href=""https://www.goatsontheroad.com/"" data-wpel-link=""internal"">Goats On The Road </a>readers get a special 25% discount by <a href=""http://trustedhousesitters.pxf.io/P02yYR"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">clicking this link. </a></p>



<p>4. <a href=""https://www.vrbo.com/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Vrbo</a>: A platform very similar to Airbnb, <a href=""https://www.vrbo.com/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Vrbo</a> offers a range of properties at competitive prices. Be sure to check both to secure the best prices and play around with your length of stay to see if you can save money by booking for longer.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Cost of Living in New Zealand</h2>



<p>I was pleasantly surprised by the cost of living in New Zealand. Even in the bigger cities, most things felt fairly reasonable, here&#8217;s the breakdown:</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Restaurants and Groceries</h3>



<p>Dining out is comparable to most US and UK destinations. You can expect to pay around <a href=""https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Auckland?displayCurrency=USD"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">$15 for a casual meal</a>, and the sky&#8217;s the limit with high-end restaurants. Generally speaking, the check for a decent dinner out will easily set you back <a href=""https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Auckland?displayCurrency=USD"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">$80-$100.</a></p>



<p>Like most places, you&#8217;ll never be far from a nice coffee shop. Your standard brew will usually cost<a href=""https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Auckland?displayCurrency=USD"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer""> $3</a> wherever you are in NZ. Meat is very affordable in New Zealand as little is imported. Beef, chicken, and especially lamb are routinely <a href=""https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Auckland?displayCurrency=USD"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">under $5/lb.</a></p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Accommodation Costs</h3>



<p>Prices will vary greatly across the country depending on whether you plan to stay in the bigger cities or more rural areas. So, using the biggest city Auckland as our benchmark, city apartments cost upwards of <a href=""https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Auckland?displayCurrency=USD"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">$1200/month</a>, with <a href=""https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Auckland?displayCurrency=USD"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">$200</a> utilities on top.</p>



<p>If planning a short stay, refine your searches using the options discussed in the previous accommodation section. You&#8217;ll find a full range of options across New Zealand, from shared hostel dorms and Airbnb rooms to luxury apartments.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Transportation Costs in New Zealand</h3>



<p>All of the major New Zealand cities are serviced by efficient, affordable, and safe public transport systems. During my time in Auckland, I frequently used the ferry to take me directly across the water into the heart of the city center. </p>



<p>Using Auckland as our guide once again, tickets for public transport start at around <a href=""https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Auckland?displayCurrency=USD"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">$2.50 per trip</a> and can be purchased online, via an app, or in person at a kiosk.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.uber.com/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Uber</a> is widely used throughout New Zealand and is an affordable and convenient way to travel, short trips cost <a href=""https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Auckland?displayCurrency=USD"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">$10-$15.</a> Gasoline prices are usually much higher than in the US or Australia &#8211; a<a href=""https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Auckland?displayCurrency=USD"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer""> gallon of gas was above $6</a> during my stay! </p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">SIM Cards, Data, and WiFi</h3>



<p>Getting connected in New Zealand is a smooth and simple process. Walking through airport arrivals at 10 pm, a <a href=""https://one.nz/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">One NZ</a> shop was open for business and had me up and running with unlimited calls, messages, and 10GB of data in minutes.</p>



<p>My plan cost me $30/month and was perfect for my needs. There are official outlets for the main vendors such as <a href=""https://www.spark.co.nz/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Spark</a>, <a href=""https://one.nz/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">One NZ (Vodaphone)</a>, and <a href=""https://www.2degrees.nz/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">2Degrees</a> in all towns and cities.</p>



<p>Data-only SIMS are cheaper but expect to pay at least <a href=""https://one.nz/prepay/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">$15/month</a> to get fully set up and connected with a basic package. </p>

<ol class=""wp-block-list"">
<li><strong>House Sit</strong>: Save on all your accommodation costs by securing house sits in New Zealand. I did it for half of my stay and you can read all about it in this <a href=""https://beachesallthewaydown.com/house-sitting-in-auckland-a-helpful-travelers-guide/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Auckland house sitting guide.</a></li>



<li><strong>Fly Domestically</strong>: Traveling between the North and South islands by train or car sounds like a great idea but is incredibly uneconomical. Budget airlines operate between all major cities and will get you there in a fraction of the time.</li>



<li><strong>Shop Around</strong>: There are a variety of popular supermarkets in New Zealand. <a href=""https://www.paknsave.co.nz/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Pak n Save</a> is generally considered the cheapest but by shopping around you&#8217;ll find different bargains in different stores.</li>



<li><strong>Op Shop</strong>: Thrift stores and op shops are prevalent throughout NZ and are always handy for picking up new books, second-hand clothing, and souvenirs. </li>



<li><strong>Embrace the Free Stuff</strong>: New Zealand is one of the most beautiful countries I&#8217;ve ever visited. Get out into the great outdoors and enjoy the opportunity for plenty of hiking, natural beauty, and beach life during your stay.</li>

<p>New Zealand experiences <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand#Climate"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">four distinct seasons,</a> offering varying weather throughout the year. October is the heart of spring in the southern hemisphere, and temperatures were dry and pleasant. This is when I visited and the landscapes really came to life. </p>



<p>The best time to travel to New Zealand depends on your plans, as each season has unique highlights. Summer (December to February) is great for beaches and hiking, while winter (June to August) attracts skiers. Spring and autumn offer fewer crowds and milder weather.</p>



<p>There’s no hurricane season, but the hot weather around holidays like Christmas and New Year can bring high travel demand. For ideal conditions, spring or early autumn both balance great weather and fewer tourists.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Pros and Cons of Living in New Zealand</h2>



<p>Like any place in the world, living in New Zealand comes with its advantages and challenges. Here&#8217;s what I learned during my stay:</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Pros of Living in New Zealand</h3>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li><strong>Stunning Natural Beauty</strong>: Breathtaking landscapes, from mountains to beaches, New Zealand truly is one of the most beautiful countries I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure of visiting.</li>

<li><strong>High Quality of Life</strong>: A clean environment, excellent healthcare, and a strong education system contribute to overall well-being.</li>



<li><strong>Adventure Opportunities</strong>: Activities such as hiking, bungee jumping, water sports, and skiing are widely available.</li>



<li><strong>Safe and Peaceful</strong>: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_New_Zealand"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Low crime rates</a> and political stability make it a secure place to live.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Cons of Living in New Zealand</h3>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">

<p>New Zealand doesn&#8217;t currently offer a specific digital nomad visa. However, remote workers often utilize the <a href=""https://freakingnomads.com/new-zealand-digital-nomad-visa/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">Visitor Visa</a> which allows stays of up to 2 years. Keep in mind that only <a href=""https://freakingnomads.com/new-zealand-digital-nomad-visa/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">certain countries are eligible</a> and certain criteria must be met.</p>



<p>For American and Canadian citizens a visa-free travel agreement permits stays of up to 90 days, while Brits can stay for up to 6 months. Remote workers need to ensure they comply with regulations (working while on a tourist visa is usually not permitted).</p>



<p>Always comprehensively research the visa situation based on your own circumstances before planning any stay in New Zealand. Your own government&#8217;s website will supply all the necessary information.
